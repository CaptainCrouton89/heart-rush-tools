# Upoceax

Tags: continent

Upoceax (pronounced "YOO-poe-say") is one of the three major continents of Alaria, located in the southwest.

## Seacleft Coast

### Geography

The Seacleft Coast occupies the northwestern edge of Upoceax—a rugged coastal region featuring dramatic cliffs that drop into the ocean. This is a land of precipitous shorelines, scattered states, and the gateway between the Farlands to the south and the waters beyond.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Northern coastline
- **East**: The Greenwater Sea and Sand Reach desert
- **South**: Transitions into the Farlands; the Vokas Enrisikna mountain range marks the boundary
- **West**: Ocean of Elorinia

#### The Vokas Enrisikna Range

A small mountain range that stretches between the Ocean of Elorinia to the west and the Bejeweled Sea to the east. This range serves as the geographic boundary between the Seacleft Coast and the Farlands to the south.

#### States

The Seacleft Coast contains a smattering of states, arranged roughly from south to north:

- **Ios** (southernmost)
- **Moigos**
- **Iqes**
- **Enavadi** (northernmost)

Plus several scattered city-states throughout the region, including Rilyn.

#### Petrona Septia Island

A major island in the Seacleft Coast containing the states of Ios and Moigos, as well as the city-state of Rilyn. The Screech Peaks mountain range divides the island, with Ios on the southwestern side and Rilyn in Puma Wood forest on the northeastern slopes.

#### Terrain

The defining feature is the coastline itself—high cliffs dropping dramatically into the ocean. The interior is less dramatic but still rugged, transitioning from the coastal cliffs to the mountain boundaries.

#### Surrounding Waters

- **Ocean of Elorinia**: The western ocean
- **Bejeweled Sea**: Eastern waters, between the Seacleft Coast and the Greenwater Sea
- **Greenwater Sea**: Further east, dominated by the island of Urok

### Birthday Wreck

Tags: shipwreck, landmark, hazard

A famous shipwreck visible at extreme low tide in the waters near the Shardmaw Isles. The shattered hull of *The Fortunate Daughter* lies in thirty feet of water, her ribs exposed like a rotting carcass, a monument to wealth, hubris, and the unforgiving nature of the Shardmaw crystals.

#### The Disaster

The story of the Birthday Wreck is taught to every child in Mirko as a cautionary tale about mainlanders who think money protects them from the sea.

Aldos Vermilion was a Linas dye-merchant who'd made an enormous fortune during a particularly successful harvesting season. To celebrate his only daughter Senna's sixteenth birthday, he hired *The Fortunate Daughter*—the grandest pleasure barge available—and announced an expedition to view the famous crystal formations of the Shardmaw Isles. He invited forty of Linas's most prominent families, hired musicians, performers, and the finest cooks money could buy. He loaded the vessel with gifts for his daughter, including a commissioned necklace from Mirko's most accomplished jeweler.

He also hired local guides. He ignored their advice about the route.

The pilots warned him that the northern approach to the viewing point required threading through a narrow channel where submerged crystals could shift position between tides. They recommended the southern route—longer, but safer. Vermilion, impatient and confident, insisted on the faster path. The guides refused to navigate it. Vermilion fired them and promoted his own helmsman.

The Shardmaw crystals opened the hull in six places. The barge sank in minutes. Forty-three people died, including Senna Vermilion. Only seven survived, Aldos among them, found clinging to a cask of his own wine by a fishing boat the next morning.

Aldos Vermilion never spoke another word. He died three years later, reportedly by his own hand, having distributed his entire fortune to the families of the dead.

#### The Wreck Today

*The Fortunate Daughter* lies on a sandy shelf between two crystal outcroppings. At extreme low tide, her masts break the surface—a grim navigation marker that locals call "the Birthday Candles." The hull is largely intact but riddled with crystal punctures, and the interior has become a maze of collapsed decks and scattered debris.

The obvious salvage was recovered decades ago. Crystal harvesters stripped the immediately accessible valuables within months of the sinking. What remains are the fragments too dangerous or too difficult to reach—cargo hold goods buried under collapsed timbers, personal effects wedged in inaccessible corners, and whatever lies in the sealed captain's cabin at the ship's lowest deck.

#### Rumors and Hooks

Despite thorough salvaging, rumors persist about treasures yet unfound:

**The Vermilion Necklace**: The birthday gift commissioned for Senna—a fortune in worked gold and enchanted stones—was never recovered. Some say it went down with Senna herself, clasped around her neck in a final gesture by her father before the sinking. Others claim it was never on the ship at all, that Aldos had it delivered separately and it was stolen during the chaos of the disaster.

**The Uninvited Guest**: Passenger manifests recovered after the sinking listed forty-two guests. Forty-three bodies were eventually recovered or confirmed dead. Someone was aboard who wasn't supposed to be, and their locked traveling chest—marked with an unfamiliar seal—has never been found.

**The Laughter Below**: Salvagers who work the wreck too long report hearing sounds from the lower decks—music, laughter, the clink of glasses. Most dismiss this as currents moving through the ruined hull, creating sounds that tired minds interpret as celebration. Others note that the sounds are always clearest on Senna Vermilion's birthday, and that divers who follow the laughter too deep don't always surface.

#### Hazards

The Birthday Wreck sits in dangerous waters. The same crystal formations that sank the ship still guard the approach. The channel that Aldos Vermilion insisted on taking has claimed at least a dozen salvage vessels since, their crews' ambition exceeding their caution.

Beyond the crystals, the wreck itself is unstable. Decks have collapsed. Timbers are rotten. The current pulls debris in unpredictable directions. And the crystal outcroppings continue to grow—slowly encroaching on the wreck, as if the Shardmaw Isles are determined to digest their most famous victim entirely.

### Edko Sound

Tags: geography, water, fishing

The sheltered waters between the Floss Islands and the Enavadi coast, Edko Sound is the heart of Enavadi's fishing industry. Named for Edko the Anchor—a legendary fisherman who supposedly mapped every current in the sound by feel alone—these protected waters produce the finest catches on the Seacleft Coast.

The sound's geography creates ideal fishing conditions. The Floss Islands break up ocean swells from the north, while the curved coastline of Enavadi shelters the waters from eastern storms. Complex current patterns concentrate fish in predictable locations, though "predictable" is relative—reading Edko Sound's moods is what separates a master fisherman from a merely competent one.

#### The Floss Islands

A scattered chain of small, rocky islands that form the northern boundary of Edko Sound. The name comes from the white sea-foam that perpetually coats the windward rocks, giving the islands a frosted appearance visible from miles away.

Each island has a distinctive silhouette that Enavadi fishermen use for navigation. Children learn to name them before they learn to read: the Needle, Fat Brother, the Widow's Teeth, Broken Basket, the Twins. A fisherman who cannot identify each island by shape in fog or darkness is not trusted with a boat.

The Floss Islands are uninhabited—the rocks are too steep, the soil too thin, and the exposure too brutal for permanent settlement. But fishermen tell stories. Lights on moonless nights, moving between islands where no one lives. Structures glimpsed at dawn that aren't there by noon. Fish that swim in perfect geometric patterns near certain rocks, then scatter when approached.

The practical-minded say it's phosphorescence and tired eyes playing tricks after long nights. The old salts say the Floss Islands remember something from before the sea rose and fell, and it's best not to anchor there overnight. No one important has ever tested the matter.

#### Fishing Grounds

The sound's currents create distinct fishing zones, each with its own character and traditions. The northern grounds near the Floss Islands produce cold-water species—firm-fleshed fish prized for preservation. The central sound, warmer and calmer, yields the delicate catches reserved for Enavadi tables rather than export. The southern approaches, where the sound meets Prince's Bay, hold the largest fish—the "princes" that give ambitious fishermen stories to tell.

Enavadi families have worked the same grounds for generations, their territories determined by custom rather than law. Disputes are rare; everyone knows which waters belong to which family, and the penalties for poaching are social rather than legal—but no less severe. A family caught working another's grounds will find their boats unwelcome at every dock in the sound.

#### The Sound's Moods

Edko Sound is not always calm. When storms break across the Floss Islands, the resulting chop can be deadly to small boats. The currents reverse twice yearly in ways that affect fish movements for weeks. Certain wind patterns create standing waves that can swamp an unwary vessel.

Every Enavadi fisherman learns to read these moods. The old tide-charts maintained by Krizan village record generations of observations—current patterns, storm approaches, seasonal shifts. These charts are copied but never sold; they represent accumulated knowledge that outsiders cannot simply purchase.

Outsiders who attempt to fish Edko Sound without local knowledge rarely succeed. The waters look deceptively simple—calm, sheltered, full of fish. But the fish move in patterns that follow the currents, and the currents follow rules that take years to learn. Visiting fishermen typically give up within a season, convinced their Enavadi counterparts are using magic. They're not. They're using a thousand years of watching the same water.

### Enavadi

Tags: state, nation, fishing

A stretch of rocky coastline and sheltered bays along the Seacleft Coast, home to the most skilled fishermen in Alaria. Enavadi is less a unified nation than a confederation of fishing villages bound by shared customs, intermarriage, and a deep suspicion of outsiders. The land is poor—thin soil, few resources, no strategic value—but the waters are rich, and the Enavadi have built everything around them.

The coast runs roughly north-south, with Edko Sound and the Floss Islands forming a natural harbor complex in the north, and Prince's Bay opening to the south toward the waters around Gyosha. Between them lie a handful of fishing villages, each with its own specialty and character, collectively producing catches that feed markets across the Seacleft Coast.

#### Edkovic

The capital, if Enavadi can be said to have one. Edkovic is the largest settlement—perhaps five thousand souls—but it feels like an overgrown fishing village that happens to host the government. No walls protect it. No monuments celebrate past victories. The architecture is practical: wooden buildings clustered around an enormous harbor complex, everything oriented toward the sea.

The **Great Docks** stretch for miles along the waterfront—a maze of wooden piers, boathouses, and chandleries organized by an elaborate system of family berths that outsiders find incomprehensible. Each extended family maintains hereditary rights to specific dock sections, passed down through generations. Disputes over berth boundaries have occasionally ended in violence, though the net-councils usually resolve such matters before blood is shed.

The **Smoking Halls** dominate the town's interior—massive communal facilities for preserving fish. The smell defines Edkovic. Visitors notice it immediately and never entirely stop noticing. The smoke-scent clings to hair, clothes, and skin for days after departure. Locals claim they can identify which village a person comes from by the particular character of smoke in their clothes.

The **Stranger's Quarter** occupies a single district where outsiders may stay, eat, and conduct trade. It is clean, adequate, and utterly without warmth. A low stone wall—not defensive, merely symbolic—separates it from the rest of Edkovic. Outsiders who venture beyond this boundary are not physically prevented, but they are watched, followed, and made to understand they are not welcome.

The **Empty Temple** stands near the Stranger's Quarter—a stone building with no god's name carved above its door. A missionary from the Middle Sea raised it three centuries ago, convinced he could bring foreign faith to these simple fishing folk. The Enavadi let him build it. They never entered. It has been a warehouse for dried nets for two hundred years, and the missionary's name has been forgotten.

#### Prince's Bay

The large southern bay where Enavadi's coast curves toward Gyosha's waters. The name carries a double meaning that locals argue about endlessly.

The historical explanation: centuries ago, a prince of Veldoraine wrecked his ship in this bay during a storm. The Enavadi rescued him, healed his injuries, and then—true to their isolationist traditions—refused to let him leave. Once you've lived among them, once you've seen how they fish, you don't go back to tell outsiders. Prince Aldric of Veldoraine lived out his decades as a fisherman, reportedly became quite skilled at it, and is buried somewhere along the bay's northern shore. His descendants, if any survive, have been Enavadi for generations.

The practical explanation: "prince" is Enavadi slang for an exceptionally large catch. Prince's Bay is where the biggest fish school, so it's "where you catch a prince."

Ask an Enavadi fisherman which explanation is correct, and they'll smile and say "both."

Somewhere in Veldoraine's dusty archives, there's still a theoretical claim to "Prince Aldric of the Enavadi Shore." No one has pressed it in two hundred years, and any envoy who tried would find the Enavadi remarkably unimpressed by foreign titles.

#### Vukaden

The northernmost village, closest to Edkovic and practically its suburb. Many Vukaden residents work in the capital but prefer village life—quieter, cleaner, with better neighbors. The village is known for **boat-building**. The Vukaden hull design—shallow draft, stable in chop, easily rowed when winds fail—has become the standard fishing vessel across the Seacleft Coast. Master shipwrights here are as respected as master fishermen, and apprenticeships are fiercely competitive.

#### Krizan

The central village, positioned where Edko Sound narrows toward Prince's Bay. Krizan is known for two things: **net-making** and **records**.

The nets that come from Krizan workshops are works of art—fine mesh that catches small fry without tangling, weighted precisely for different current conditions, repaired so skillfully that a net can last generations. "Krizan thread catches what Enavadi eyes can't see," the saying goes.

More importantly, Krizan maintains the oldest **tide-charts** in Enavadi—generations of meticulous records documenting current patterns, storm approaches, fish movements, and seasonal variations. These charts are copied for other villages but never sold to outsiders. They represent accumulated knowledge that cannot simply be purchased, and the Krizan record-keepers guard them accordingly.

#### Dijana

The southernmost village, nearest the waters around Gyosha. By Enavadi standards, Dijana is cosmopolitan—which isn't saying much. The village is known for **fish preservation**: salting, smoking, and drying techniques that allow Enavadi catches to travel far beyond fresh-fish range. Dijana's preserved fish reaches markets across the Seacleft Coast and beyond.

The village's proximity to Gyosha has other consequences. Some quiet trade happens with Mirko here—smugglers who know Dijana's shores, fishermen who occasionally carry cargo that isn't fish. The Tide Council in Edkovic pretends not to notice. Dijana's elders justify the arrangement as "keeping the criminals where we can see them," and everyone maintains the polite fiction that Enavadi has no dealings with the lawless city-state to the south.

### Fernius Sound

Tags: sea, geography

The body of water east of Petrona Septia Island, separating the island from the scattered archipelagos and open waters beyond. Fernius Sound is broad, deep, and relatively calm — better sailing than the hazardous waters around the Tyvern Isles to the north or the shallow approaches to Phylos Bay in the west.

The sound sees moderate traffic: fishing boats from the Petrona Septia settlements, occasional merchant vessels heading to or from Rilyn, and the rare ship making for the more remote eastern destinations. It's not a major trade route — Petrona Septia's states don't generate enough commerce for that — but it's navigable and relatively safe.

#### Character

Fernius Sound lacks the dramatic dangers of other regional waters. No hidden reefs tear at hulls. No supernatural darkness bleeds from nearby shores. No volcanic ridges lurk below the surface. The sound is simply a stretch of sea that ships cross without incident.

This very ordinariness makes Fernius Sound valuable. Ships that want to avoid the complications of Scatter Sound or the Kappa-controlled approaches to Moigos can circle around through Fernius Sound instead. The route is longer but simpler — useful for captains who prefer predictable sailing over faster passages with complications.

#### Surkelm Coast

The eastern shore of Fernius Sound belongs to the Surkelm region — forested coastline stretching northeast from Petrona Septia toward the mainland. The coast is lightly populated, with scattered fishing villages and the occasional logging camp. No significant settlements exist here; the terrain is too rough and the connections to larger markets too poor.

The Surkelm forests supply timber to those willing to pay for it, but harvesting and transporting the logs is difficult enough that most buyers look elsewhere. The region's main significance is as a landmark — ships navigating Fernius Sound use the Surkelm headlands for orientation.

#### Rilyn's Access

Rilyn, the Splinkreen city-state on Petrona Septia's eastern shore, has its primary sea access through Fernius Sound. The Splinkreen aren't major seafarers — their culture is oriented toward forests rather than water — but they maintain small harbors for the fishing and limited trade that their economy requires.

Ships visiting Rilyn typically approach through Fernius Sound, avoiding the more complicated routes around the island's other coasts. The Splinkreen welcome visitors, in their slow and deliberate way, though the city-state doesn't generate enough trade to attract many merchant vessels.

#### The Eastern Waters

Beyond Fernius Sound lies the open sea — the Agreben Sea to the south and east, eventually reaching the distant coasts of other lands. Few ships from Petrona Septia venture that far. The island's states are oriented inward, toward each other and the nearby coasts, not toward distant maritime connections.

Occasionally, ships from far lands appear in Fernius Sound, having crossed the open water for reasons of their own. These visitors are rare enough to be memorable. What they're looking for on Petrona Septia — trade, information, something else entirely — varies with each arrival.

### Floating Islands of Aleve Akribus

Tags: island, geography, magical

A cluster of islands that hang suspended in the air above the sea, southwest of the Torguli Islands chain. The Floating Islands of Aleve Akribus drift at altitudes ranging from fifty to several hundred feet, their positions shifting slowly with winds that don't match the currents below. From a distance, they appear as dark shapes against the sky — obviously solid, obviously not where islands should be.

No one knows why they float. The islands have hung in the air for as long as anyone remembers, and theories about their origin range from ancient magic to leyline anomalies to something buried in the islands' cores that defies natural law. Whatever the cause, the effect is undeniable: these islands do not touch the water.

#### The Islands

The cluster contains perhaps a dozen major islands and numerous smaller rocks, all suspended at varying heights. The largest islands support vegetation — trees grow sideways from cliff edges, roots dangling into empty air; grasses cover the upper surfaces; vines trail down toward the sea below without ever reaching it. The smallest are bare rock, slowly eroding as wind and rain wear them away with nothing below to catch the debris.

The islands drift. Not quickly — their movement is measured in feet per day rather than miles — but continuously. The cluster's general position remains consistent (southwest of the Torguli chain), but individual islands shift relative to each other. Gaps that existed yesterday may be closed today; islands that were neighbors may have drifted apart.

Some islands trail vegetation, vines, or even waterfalls from their undersides — fresh water from springs that have nowhere to go but down. This water falls into the sea, a continuous rain beneath the floating rocks.

#### Access

Reaching Aleve Akribus is the primary challenge. The islands have no harbors because ships cannot dock at something that floats in the air. The approaches include:

**Flight**: The obvious solution, available to those with wings or magic. Flying creatures can reach the islands easily, and whatever lives there presumably uses this method.

**Climbing**: Some islands trail vegetation low enough to grab from a ship's mast or a small boat. Climbing the vines is possible but dangerous — the plants are living things that sway in the wind, and falling means falling into the sea from significant height.

**The Bridges**: Rumors persist of rope bridges connecting some islands to the Torguli chain's outermost rocks — constructed by someone, maintained by someone, used by someone. If these bridges exist, they're not visible from normal sailing distances, and those who know their locations don't advertise them.

#### Inhabitants

The islands aren't empty. From below, observers have seen:
- Smoke rising from structures that can't be clearly resolved
- Lights at night, moving between islands
- Shapes that might be people, or might be something else
- What appear to be buildings, though their architecture doesn't match any known culture

Whoever or whatever lives on Aleve Akribus doesn't come down. Ships that anchor beneath the islands and wait are ignored. Shouts go unanswered. Signals aren't returned. The inhabitants — if that's what they are — show no interest in contact with those below.

Occasionally, things fall from the islands. Usually debris — branches, rocks, fragments of what might be pottery or tools. Rarely, more significant objects: an artifact of unknown purpose, a body of indeterminate species, a sealed container with contents that raise more questions than answers. These falls appear accidental rather than intentional, but with beings who won't communicate, intentions are impossible to determine.

#### Speculation

Theories about Aleve Akribus fill tavern conversations across the Seacleft Coast:

**Ancient refuge**: The islands were lifted deliberately by some ancient power, creating an inaccessible sanctuary. The current inhabitants are descendants of whoever fled there, or guardians left behind, or something else entirely.

**Natural phenomenon**: Certain rocks, under certain conditions, simply float. The islands are a geological curiosity rather than a magical creation, and the inhabitants are simply people who found a way to reach them and decided to stay.

**Prison**: The islands were raised to isolate something dangerous. What lives there isn't a population — it's a captive, or captives, kept away from the world for reasons that remain valid.

**Ongoing experiment**: Someone is using the islands for something, and the lack of contact is deliberate concealment rather than indifference.

None of these theories can be confirmed without reaching the islands and speaking to their inhabitants — neither of which has been accomplished by anyone willing to share what they learned.

#### Coral Hills

Hills made of coral/sandstone that have been revealed after sea levels fell. Full of deep caves. Rumored that lots of pirates have their treasure buried here. Immune to stone magic, so quite secure.

#### Shardmaw Isles

Northwest of Gyosha and west of the Coral Hills lie the Shardmaw Isles—a treacherous archipelago rich in magical crystals. These razor-sharp crystalline formations jut from the seafloor, some rising up to forty feet above the water's surface. The crystals are prized for weapon-making, capable of holding an impossibly keen edge, but they are equally effective at destroying ships.

Navigating the Shardmaw Isles is a deadly proposition—the crystalline protrusions tear through hulls with ease, sending vessels to the bottom. The isles are adjacent to the Shipwreck Hills, where boats torn to pieces by the crystal fangs frequently wash ashore, their wreckage a testament to the danger these waters pose.

#### Shipwreck Hills

West of Gyosha lie the Shipwreck Hills—a series of islands whose hills are dotted with the remains of countless wrecked vessels. Ships destroyed by the nearby Shardmaw Isles wash ashore here, their broken hulls littering the landscape like tombstones in a maritime graveyard.

The hills are inhospitable not just because of the treacherous terrain, but because they are home to rusalka and wyrms. The wyrms—serpentine creatures that once roamed the crust of the world as titans the size of mountain ranges—have diminished over the ages. Now they rarely exceed a thousand feet in length, but they are still formidable predators. The combination of predatory wyrms and deadly water spirits makes the Shipwreck Hills a place to avoid, despite the potential salvage opportunities among the wrecks.

### Ios

Tags: state, nation

The southwestern state on Petrona Septia Island, Ios occupies the lands between the Screech Peaks and the sea. Once a prosperous civilization that solved the problem of labor through magical automation, Ios is now in slow decline — its animated stone servants are breaking down, the art of creating them is lost, and the society built around their labor is struggling to adapt.

The terrain varies from mountain foothills around the capital Todakres, through river valleys where most settlements cluster, to the Koilos forest in the south. The Dipindre River and its tributary the Nioplenese provide water and transportation, while the coast offers limited access to the sea through the shallow harbor at Methons.

#### Rivers

**Dipindre River**: The main waterway of Ios, flowing from the Screech Peaks southwest through the heart of the state before reaching the coast near Methons. The river valley is where most of Ios's population lives — the land is fertile, the water is reliable, and the terrain is gentler than the surrounding hills and mountains.

Settlements dot the Dipindre's banks: Tolosa and Capsa in the middle reaches, with smaller villages and farms throughout. The river is navigable for small boats, though nothing like the commerce that flows through Moigos's waterways.

**Nioplenese River**: A tributary joining the Dipindre from the east, draining the lands between the mountains and the Koilos forest. The Nioplenese valley is less populated than the main river, but the eastern settlements depend on it for water and transportation.

#### Capital and Cities

**Todakres** — The capital of Ios, built into the foothills of the Screech Peaks where the mountains provide natural defenses and the high ground offers strategic advantage. Todakres is old — older than the current state, older than the stone doll tradition, old enough that no one remembers who built the original fortifications.

The city is vertical, climbing the mountainside in terraces connected by stairs and ramps. The stone dolls that once handled all heavy labor made this possible — goods could be carried up endless stairs by tireless servants, water could be hauled from the river below, waste could be removed without human effort. Now, with the dolls failing, the upper terraces are being abandoned. The population is slowly migrating downward, leaving empty buildings and broken mechanisms behind.

The ruling families of Ios maintain their estates in Todakres, clinging to traditions established when the stone dolls made such luxury possible. They're aware of the crisis. They have no idea how to solve it.

**Methons** — The coastal city, such as it is. Methons sits on Phylos Bay where the Dipindre River reaches the sea, but the harbor is shallow and silted — suitable for fishing boats, not merchant vessels. What little maritime trade Ios conducts happens here, with goods transferred to smaller craft that can navigate the difficult approaches.

Methons has always been secondary to Todakres. The stone dolls made coastal access less important — why trade by sea when your automated servants can carry anything overland? Now that the dolls are failing, Methons's limitations are becoming a serious problem. Ios can't easily import what it needs or export what it produces.

#### Settlements

**Petras** — A hill town in the upper Dipindre valley, known for quarrying the stone used to make the dolls. The quarries still operate, producing building materials, but the specialized stone that went into doll construction was exhausted generations ago — or so the craftspeople claim. Some believe deposits remain undiscovered.

**Rhodanos** — A farming community in the central valley, one of the most productive agricultural areas in Ios. The stone dolls worked the fields here within living memory. Now humans must do the work, and the fields are shrinking as the labor force proves inadequate.

**Tolosa** — A market town where the Dipindre valley widens, serving as a trading hub for the surrounding settlements. Tolosa has adapted better than most to the loss of the dolls — it was always a place of commerce rather than production, and commerce can continue even when production falters.

**Capsa** — A town at the confluence of the Dipindre and Nioplenese rivers, strategically positioned to control traffic on both waterways. Capsa has a defensive tradition, having served as a strongpoint in various conflicts, and maintains walls that most Ios settlements lack.

#### Koilos

The forest covering southern Ios, stretching from the Dipindre valley to the coast. Koilos is dense and largely unexplored — the stone dolls never worked there (they were designed for agriculture and construction, not forestry), and Ios never developed a timber industry.

The forest is rumored to hold ruins from before the current settlement, structures that predate even Todakres. Whether these are remnants of an earlier civilization or something else entirely, no one knows. Few Ios citizens venture into Koilos, and those who do don't always return.

#### The Screech Peaks (Ios Side)

The southwestern slopes of the Screech Peaks define Ios's northern boundary. The mountains provide natural defenses, mineral resources, and the headwaters of the Dipindre River. The passes through to Moigos are few and difficult, limiting contact between the states.

Todakres is built against these mountains, using their height for defense and their stone for construction. The upper reaches above the city are wild — home to the creatures that give the Screech Peaks their name.

### Iqes Sound

Tags: sea, geography, trade

The body of water south of Iqes, between the island and the Upoceax mainland. Unlike the treacherous Ripmaw Sound to the west or the ship-killing waters around the Golem's Teeth to the east, Iqes Sound is relatively safe — the main artery for legitimate trade flowing to and from Mjiqa.

The sound is broad, deep, and well-charted. Merchant vessels from across the Seacleft Coast pass through daily, carrying goods to Iqes's markets and returning laden with exports. The waters are busy enough that pirates rarely operate here openly; too many witnesses, too many potential rescuers, too much risk of encountering an Iqes privateer who'd rather eliminate competition than share hunting grounds.

#### Trade Routes

Three major shipping lanes cross Iqes Sound:

**The Mjiqa Approach** — The direct route from the southern mainland ports to Iqes's capital. Wide, well-marked, and patrolled by privateers who protect paying merchants (and note which ships haven't paid). This is how most foreign trade reaches Iqes.

**The Coastal Run** — A route hugging the Iqes shoreline, connecting the smaller ports and fishing villages. Local traffic mostly — Qindo fishermen, coastal traders, small merchants who can't afford privateer protection and rely on being too poor to rob.

**The Eastern Passage** — The route toward the Golem's Teeth and beyond to Ederri and the deeper Agreben Sea. Less traveled, more dangerous, used by ships heading to the salvage operations at Shredwreck or the truly desperate seeking the Voidlock Passage.

#### The Privateer Presence

Iqes Sound is where the privateers make their money legitimate. Licensed raiders who prey on foreign shipping in distant waters return here to sell their captures, resupply, and enjoy their earnings. The sound itself is neutral ground — attacking ships in Iqes Sound would invite retaliation from every ring-holder whose commerce depends on safe passage.

This creates an odd dynamic: the same captains who'd happily sink a merchant vessel in open water will escort that vessel's sister ship through Iqes Sound for a fee. Business is business. The privateers maintain a rough order in the sound, not from virtue but from self-interest.

#### The Pin Isles

The northern boundary of Iqes Sound is marked by the Pin Isles — a chain of narrow, pointed islands stretching between Iqes and Gyosha. The isles are named for their distinctive shapes: vertical spires of rock that jut from the water like pins stuck in a cushion.

The Pin Isles mark the boundary between Iqes's waters and Gyosha's sphere of influence. Fishing rights in the channels between the pins are contested; Iqes fishermen and Mirko-affiliated boats from Gyosha regularly clash over the best grounds. These disputes rarely escalate beyond thrown punches and cut nets — neither side wants to start a real conflict — but tensions simmer constantly.

The isles themselves are uninhabited. The rock is too steep for settlement, the soil nonexistent, the exposure too brutal. But the channels between them are excellent fishing grounds, and the spires make useful landmarks for navigation. Several of the larger pins have been marked with painted symbols — territorial claims, navigation aids, or warnings, depending on who you ask.

#### Weather and Hazards

Iqes Sound is safer than neighboring waters, but "safer" is relative. Storms sweep through seasonally, and the sound's broad expanse offers no shelter once weather turns. Ships caught in the open have two choices: run for the nearest port or ride it out and hope.

The sound's depth means few submerged hazards, but the currents can be treacherous. Where the sound meets Ripmaw Sound to the west, conflicting currents create confused seas that have swamped unwary vessels. The eastern approaches toward the Golem's Teeth grow progressively more dangerous as the seafloor rises and rock formations multiply.

Fog is common in spring and autumn, reducing visibility to ship-lengths and making navigation by landmark impossible. Experienced captains anchor and wait; impatient ones sometimes find the coast sooner than expected.

### Iqes

Tags: state, nation, island

A large, heavily forested island off the Seacleft Coast, roughly three hundred miles long and two hundred fifty miles wide. Iqes is home to the Qindo people — dark-skinned humans and halflings with distinctive piercing blue eyes — though political power lies largely with foreign-descended merchant families who control the island's glittering coastal cities.

The island's terrain is dominated by dense forest, cut by two major river systems and ringed by waters that range from merely dangerous to actively lethal. The interior remains largely traditional Qindo territory; the coasts are where foreign influence concentrates, where the coral-and-mica cities rise, and where the wealth flows.

#### Ntando

The forested western interior of Iqes, Ntando is the traditional Qindo heartland — the region where native culture survived most intact after foreign merchants took control of the coastal cities. The name means something like "the old places" in the Qindo tongue, and the description is apt.

While the coastal cities glitter with coral architecture and foreign fashions, Ntando remains a land of forest villages, subsistence farming, and traditions that predate the merchant takeover. The foreign elite consider it backwards and poor. The Qindo consider it *real* — the place where ancestors are properly honored, where the old ways persist, where being Qindo means something more than a servant class in someone else's city.

Ntando is governed by village elders rather than voting rings. The council in Mjiqa claims authority here, but enforcement is spotty; ring-holders who venture into the deep forest find their writs carry little weight. Tax collectors come through seasonally; they take what they can and leave. Open rebellion is rare, but so is genuine compliance.

The highlands along Ntando's western edge hold particular significance. This is where the halflings once had their mountain caves — elaborate underground communities destroyed during the foreign consolidation. The entrances are collapsed now, poisoned or buried, but the halflings remember. Some still make pilgrimages to the ruined sites.

#### The Rivers

**Shulka River**: The main waterway of Iqes, flowing from the forested interior southeast to the coast at Mjiqa. The Shulka is the island's economic artery — broad enough for trade boats through most of its length, essential for moving goods from the interior to the capital. Whoever controls the Shulka controls Iqes's internal commerce.

The river's upper reaches flow through traditional Qindo territory, lined with fishing villages and small farming communities. As it approaches Mjiqa, the banks become increasingly developed — warehouses, docks, the estates of ring-holders who want river access without living in the crowded capital.

**Myusha River**: The northern river, flowing past Zukisani to the coast. Slower and broader than the Shulka, the Myusha serves the northern forests and connects to the fishing grounds near Gyosha. The name reportedly means "gentle water" or "mother river" in old Qindo.

The Myusha valley is more integrated than the Shulka — Qindo and foreign-descended communities mix more easily here, the result of generations of intermarriage and shared economic interests. Zukisani, at the river's mouth, reflects this relative harmony.

#### Cities

##### Mjiqa

The capital of Iqes, situated at the mouth of the Shulka River. Mjiqa is where the coral-and-mica architecture reaches its most dramatic expression — towers of cultivated pink coral, walls that shimmer with mica flakes, broad plazas where the wealthy display their status in imported fashions and ostentatious jewelry.

Look past the glitter and you see the machinery of power: the Ring Hall where the council meets, the Coral Docks where trade flows, the Privateers' Berths where licensed raiders spend their earnings. And in the crowded Qindo Quarter, the workers who make it all function — dockworkers, servants, sailors, craftspeople whose labor builds the wealth they'll never share.

Mjiqa is two cities in one. The ring-holders see a jewel of commerce and culture. The Qindo see a stolen inheritance.

##### Simphiwe

The western city, gateway to Ntando. Simphiwe sits at the edge of the great forests, serving as the commercial bridge between the traditional interior and the coastal economy. This is the most Qindo of the cities — foreign merchants come here to buy Ntando goods, but they don't dominate the way they do in Mjiqa.

The architecture blends coral-city style with traditional Ntando woodwork. The markets sell forest products alongside imported luxuries. The voting rings matter here, but so do older forms of respect — a ring-holder who insults local customs finds their business mysteriously difficult.

Simphiwe has the largest urban halfling population, many maintaining connections to the destroyed cave-homes in the nearby mountains. The halfling district is culturally significant; ceremonies commemorating the lost caves happen here, attended by halflings from across Iqes.

##### Zukisani

The northern city on the Myusha River, controlling river trade from the northern forests and serving as Iqes's connection to Gyosha and the waters beyond. Less grand than Mjiqa, more practical — a working city where ships are built, goods are processed, and the fishing fleet operates.

Zukisani has a reputation for relatively honest dealing. The ring-holders here are merchants and shipwrights, not aristocrats playing political games. Qindo and foreign-descended residents mix more easily; the inequality remains, but the contempt is muted.

The shipyards of Zukisani are famous across the Seacleft Coast. The city also serves as the primary port for trade with Mirko and Gyosha — connections that bring both commerce and complications.

##### Zuko

The southern interior city, controlling land routes through Iqes's forested heart. Zuko is where the ring-holders maintain their grip on the interior — tax collection, law enforcement, and military garrisons when the elite feel threatened by Ntando restlessness.

Less beautiful than Mjiqa, more fortified, Zuko is the fist inside Iqes's velvet glove. The garrison here is larger than a trading city needs; its purpose is control rather than defense. The Tax Houses process tribute from villages throughout the interior.

Ironically, Zuko also contains the best-organized resistance cells. The city that suppresses dissent is close enough to Ntando to feel its grievances, and not everyone in the garrison is loyal to the ring-holders.

Near Zuko lie the ruins of the largest halfling cave-complex — deliberately destroyed during the consolidation, now a scar on the landscape that halflings visit in quiet pilgrimage.

#### Towns and Villages

**Menzi**: A river town upstream from Mjiqa on the Shulka, where goods transfer between river boats and pack animals heading into the interior. A waystation for commerce, busy during trading seasons.

**Zendile**: A fishing town on the Ripmaw Sound coast, with connections to the Cast Cays. The local pilots who guide ships through Ripmaw Sound's dangerous channels often come from Zendile.

**Qonwabi**: A traditional Qindo village in the western highlands, near the ruined halfling caves. Relatively isolated, maintaining old customs with minimal foreign interference.

**Feza**: A crossroads town in the southern interior, where routes from Zuko meet paths to the coast. Small but strategic; travelers heading anywhere in southern Iqes likely pass through.

#### Golem's Teeth

An archipelago of jagged islands east of Iqes proper, named for the sharp, tooth-like rock formations that rise from the sea. The treacherous waters and razor-sharp rocks have claimed countless ships over the centuries.

The Golem's Teeth mark the eastern boundary of safe navigation around Iqes. Beyond them lie the open waters of the Agreben Sea and the underwater hazards of Ederri. Ships that must pass the Teeth do so carefully, following established channels and praying the weather holds.

##### Islands North of Golem's Teeth

The smaller islands scattered north of the main Golem's Teeth archipelago are avoided by sailors who know the local legends.

###### Dreadwreck

The location of a cursed shipwreck — a Gruynmar vessel that ran aground after its entire crew was petrified by a gorgon. The ship smashed against the rocks and now lies broken on the shore, its stone crew still frozen in their final moments of terror. The wreck is shunned by all who know of it, as the gorgon still makes its lair among the petrified sailors, waiting for new victims to add to its collection of statues.

#### Ederri

An underwater sinkhole region off the eastern coast of Iqes in the Agreben Sea. The sinkholes descend into deep underwater caverns and passages.

##### Voidlock Passage

Deep within the Ederri sinkholes lies the collapsed, underwater Voidlock Passage — once a seagate leading to the underrealm of Zylogmus Eternus. The passage has collapsed but remains partially functional in a strange way: as you descend deeper and deeper into the flooded tunnels, the water becomes shared between the two locations, existing in both places simultaneously. This creates a dangerous phenomenon where currents from Zylogmus Eternus can pull swimmers into the underrealm without warning.

TODO

### Moigos

Tags: state, nation

The northern state on Petrona Septia Island, Moigos occupies the lowland forests and river valleys north of the Screech Peaks. The terrain is wet — streams, bogs, and flooded forests dominate the landscape — and the Kappa who rule here prefer it that way. The toad-folk crime lords have built their power in these swampy woodlands, running a state where official government is a polite fiction and real authority flows through debts, favors, and fear.

Moigos settlements are inland, clustered along the two major rivers that drain the region. There's no significant coast — the shoreline is either the supernatural darkness around the Isle of the Night or the treacherous waters of Scatter Sound. Trade that reaches Moigos comes overland or through carefully negotiated passages.

#### Rivers

**Qulyintes River**: The primary waterway of Moigos, flowing from the foothills of the Screech Peaks northwest through the heart of the state. The capital Thetin sits where the river widens into a series of connected pools and channels. Calentia lies upstream, closer to the mountains.

The Qulyintes is navigable for flat-bottomed boats through most of its length, making it the main artery for moving goods and people through Moigos. The Kappa control river traffic — not officially, but through ownership of the boats, the docks, and the warehouses where cargo changes hands.

**Skraigos River**: The western waterway, running roughly parallel to the Qulyintes before draining into Phylos Bay. Ragusa and Hepetas sit along its banks. The Skraigos is narrower and faster than the Qulyintes, less useful for commerce but important for the settlements it serves.

#### Settlements

**Thetin** — The capital, though "capital" implies a formality that Moigos doesn't really have. Thetin is simply where the most powerful Kappa live, where the largest markets operate, and where anyone who wants to do serious business in Moigos must eventually come.

The town sprawls across both banks of the Qulyintes where the river spreads into a maze of channels and islands. Buildings are built on stilts or artificial mounds, connected by bridges and boardwalks. The architecture is practical rather than beautiful — wood and wattle construction that can be rebuilt when floods or fires claim it.

The Kappa don't rule from a palace. They rule from counting houses, from backroom tables, from anywhere a debt can be recorded and a favor called in. Thetin's nominal government — a council of merchant families — meets regularly and accomplishes nothing that the Kappa haven't already decided.

**Calentia** — Upstream on the Qulyintes, closer to the Screech Peaks. Calentia handles trade coming over the mountains from Ios and serves as a waystation for goods moving to and from Thetin. The town is drier than the capital, built on higher ground where the river valley narrows.

Calentia has a reputation for being slightly more honest than Thetin — the Kappa presence is lighter here, and legitimate merchants can operate with fewer complications. This reputation is carefully cultivated and only partially true.

**Ragusa** — The larger of the two Skraigos River towns, Ragusa sits where the river is still navigable. The town processes timber from the Alegheim forest and agricultural products from the surrounding wetlands. It's a working town, less political than Thetin, more focused on actual production.

**Hepetas** — Smaller and further upstream on the Skraigos, Hepetas marks the edge of navigable water. Beyond here, the river becomes too shallow and fast for boats. The town serves the villages and farms of the upper valley and handles overland traffic heading west toward Phylos Bay.

#### Urun Mountains

The eastern wall of Moigos, separating the swamplands from Fernius Sound. Where the Screech Peaks divide Petrona Septia's interior, the Urun range defines its eastern coast — a spine of grey granite and black shale running north-south along the water's edge. The mountains aren't tall, but they're steep and densely forested on the lower slopes, giving way to bare rock and scree above.

The Kappa treat the Urun differently than they treat the swamps. The lowland forests are their domain, woven through with debts and obligations. The mountains are... storage.

##### Lower Slopes

The accessible valleys and foothills are where the Kappa keep what they don't want found. Mining camps work veins of copper and iron, staffed by debtors who defaulted and found themselves with no other way to pay. The work isn't slavery — technically. The workers chose this over the alternatives the Kappa offered. They'll be free when their debts are cleared. The debts, somehow, never quite clear.

Beyond the mines, the lower Urun hold caches known only to specific Kappa families. Wealth that can't be kept in counting houses. Evidence that might prove useful someday. Bodies that were never meant to be found. The mountains don't judge, and stone keeps secrets better than swamp mud.

Calentia serves as the gateway to the Urun. Anyone heading into the mountains passes through, and the Kappa-connected merchants there note who goes up and who comes down. Legitimate prospectors are tolerated — they occasionally find something valuable, and their discoveries always seem to benefit the right people. Treasure hunters heading for rumored caches are watched more carefully. Most don't come back.

##### Upper Reaches

Above the treeline, the Kappa's influence fades. Not because they lack the reach, but because they choose not to extend it.

The toad-folk keep records going back centuries — meticulous accounts of debts, agreements, and territorial arrangements. Those records include a simple note, repeated across generations: *don't dig too deep*. No explanation. No context. Just the instruction, passed down like any other piece of institutional knowledge.

Something was in the Urun before the Kappa came to Moigos. Before humans settled Petrona Septia. Ruins mark certain peaks — foundations of structures built from stones too large to have been carried up the slopes, carved with symbols that don't match any known script. The screechers from the Screech Peaks won't fly over certain ridges. Goats that wander too high don't come back, but neither do their bones turn up.

The Kappa don't talk about the upper Urun. They don't forbid travel there — that would invite questions. They simply ensure that anyone asking about the high peaks receives no useful information, and anyone who goes looking finds the paths surprisingly difficult to follow.

Whatever sleeps in the upper Urun has been sleeping a long time. The Kappa see no reason to wake it.

##### The Fernius Gap

A single pass cuts through the Urun to the Fernius Sound coast — a narrow defile that sees occasional use by traders who'd rather avoid the longer route around the mountains. The Kappa control both ends, naturally. Tolls are reasonable. Delays are not unheard of. Cargo is occasionally "inspected" and found to be in violation of regulations that no one can quite cite.

The gap is also how certain goods enter and leave Moigos without appearing in any official records. Ships anchor in hidden coves along Fernius Sound; cargo moves through the pass by night; by morning, it's in Kappa warehouses with paperwork showing it arrived through entirely legitimate channels. The merchants of Calentia know better than to ask questions.

#### Alegheim

The forest covering northern Moigos, stretching from the Qulyintes River to the coast near Blink Creek. Alegheim is dense, wet, and dark — the canopy blocks most sunlight, and the ground is perpetually soggy. The trees are adapted to standing water, their roots spreading wide and shallow.

The Kappa consider Alegheim their natural territory. The swampy forest suits their physiology, and they've maintained hidden places throughout — meeting spots, caches, bolt-holes for when affairs in town become complicated. Humans and other races live in Alegheim too, in villages along the rivers and clearings, but they live with the understanding that the forest belongs to others.

The forest's edge approaches the Isle of the Night and the Gloomterror's influence. The western reaches of Alegheim are darker than they should be, and the things that live there are stranger than ordinary swamp creatures.

#### Isle of the Night

West of the mainland, situated in the waters between Moigos and the Tyvern Isles, lies the Isle of the Night — a mysterious island enveloped within the Gloomterror Forest.

##### Gloomterror Forest

An otherworldly forest that covers the island, where darkness is absolute and unnatural. The boundary between normal forest and Gloomterror isn't sharp — light fades gradually as you approach, colors drain away, and by the time you realize something is wrong, you're deeper than you meant to go.

###### Blackpoint

An island location within the Gloomterror Forest, totally shrouded in impenetrable shadows. No source of light works on this island — torches gutter, magical light fails, and even the sun seems unable to pierce the supernatural darkness.

Immense treasure is said to be buried on Blackpoint, drawing countless treasure hunters despite the impossibility of searching in absolute darkness. The island is guarded by umbral citadels — living shadows that have taken fortress-form, attacking any who dare set foot on the lightless shore.

The Kappa don't control Blackpoint — no one does. But they control who gets to try reaching it. Expeditions seeking the island's rumored wealth must pass through Moigos, and the Kappa take their cut coming and going. They've funded expeditions, profited from failures, and collected on debts owed by the dead.

### Murder Point

Tags: poi, landmark, history

A rocky headland on Iqes's eastern coast, jutting into the dangerous waters near the Golem's Teeth. The name is not metaphorical.

Murder Point has served as an execution site for over two centuries — first during the foreign merchant takeover of Iqes, when native leaders who resisted were thrown from its cliffs, and continuously since as the preferred disposal method for the ring-holders' enemies. The bodies go into the churning water below, where currents carry them into the Golem's Teeth. Few are ever recovered.

#### The Original Murders

When foreign merchants consolidated their control over Iqes roughly two hundred years ago, resistance concentrated among the traditional Qindo leadership — village elders, halfling clan-chiefs, and the loose council of headmen who'd governed before the outsiders arrived. These leaders were systematically eliminated.

The merchants wanted the deaths to be public, memorable, and deniable. Murder Point provided all three. Victims were brought to the headland, accused of various crimes against commerce and order, and pushed from the cliff edge. The official story was that they'd been exiled and the sea had claimed them. Everyone knew the truth. That was the point.

Dozens died here in the consolidation period. The Qindo remember their names. The ring-holders do not.

#### Continuing Use

The headland never stopped serving its purpose. The voting ring system created new enemies — rivals, rebels, criminals, and those who simply knew too much. Formal execution was messy, created martyrs, invited questions. Murder Point was cleaner.

A prisoner brought to the point at night, witnesses kept minimal, a brief ceremony of accusation, and then the drop. The currents did the rest. By morning, any evidence had scattered across miles of seafloor or been pulled into the rocks of the Golem's Teeth.

The practice continues. Ring-holders don't discuss it openly, but everyone in Mjiqa knows what it means when someone "went to the point." The phrase has become a threat, a warning, a promise of consequences for those who cross the wrong people.

#### The Place Itself

Murder Point is not impressive to look at — a bare rock promontory perhaps a hundred feet above the waterline, scoured by wind and spray, with no structures or markers. The cliff edge is crumbling in places, undercut by centuries of waves. Standing there, you can see the Golem's Teeth to the northeast, the waters churning between the jagged rocks.

The Qindo avoid the headland. They say the ghosts of the murdered linger there, unable to rest because their bodies were never properly buried. Some claim to have seen lights on the point at night, or heard voices calling from the cliff edge. The ring-holders dismiss these stories as native superstition.

Whether superstition or truth, something about Murder Point unsettles even skeptics. The wind sounds wrong there. The shadows fall at odd angles. Animals won't approach the cliff edge. Those who've witnessed executions report that the victims sometimes seem to be pulled rather than pushed — as if something below reached up to claim them.

#### Significance

Murder Point represents Iqes's dual nature. The glittering coral cities, the proud trading culture, the sophisticated voting ring system — all of it rests on a foundation of violence and dispossession. The Qindo know this. The foreign elite prefer not to think about it.

For players, Murder Point is both a location and a symbol. Someone brought here is meant to disappear. Someone who escapes from here has defied the powers that rule Iqes. And someone investigating the headland's history might uncover secrets that powerful people would kill to keep buried — if killing could be done more discreetly than usual.

### Phylos Bay

Tags: sea, geography

A large bay on the western coast of Petrona Septia Island, where the Dipindre River meets the sea and the city of Methons maintains its shallow harbor. Phylos Bay is broad and sheltered from the worst weather, but its waters are treacherously shallow — the bay floor rises gradually from the open sea, limiting access to vessels with modest drafts.

The bay's limitations have shaped the development of western Petrona Septia. A deep harbor here would have made Methons a significant port; instead, the city remains a fishing town with delusions of maritime commerce. Ships that want to trade with Ios must either anchor in the outer bay and transfer cargo to smaller boats, or find other routes entirely.

#### The Shallows

The central problem of Phylos Bay is the seafloor. Sediment from the Dipindre River has accumulated over centuries, building up sandbars and mudflats that extend far from the shoreline. The navigable channel shifts with storms and seasons, and even local pilots sometimes misjudge the depth.

Large merchant vessels don't attempt the inner bay at all. They anchor in the deeper water near the bay's mouth and wait for lighters — small, flat-bottomed boats — to ferry cargo to and from Methons. This adds cost, time, and complication to every shipment, making trade with Ios less profitable than it might otherwise be.

The fishing boats that work Phylos Bay have no such problems. Their shallow drafts let them navigate anywhere in the bay, and the same silted bottom that frustrates merchants creates excellent habitat for the fish and shellfish that sustain Methons's economy.

#### Methons Harbor

The harbor at Methons is adequate for fishing — protected from weather, with beaches where boats can be hauled out and docks where catches can be landed. It's inadequate for serious commerce, lacking the depth for merchant vessels and the infrastructure for large-scale cargo handling.

The Ios ruling families have discussed dredging the harbor for generations. The stone dolls could have done it easily; human labor makes it impractical. The harbor remains as it's always been — useful for fish, frustrating for everything else.

#### The Skraigos Outflow

The Skraigos River empties into the northern reaches of Phylos Bay, adding its sediment to the Dipindre's. The river mouth is even shallower than Methons harbor — navigable only for the smallest boats, and even those must know the channels. The Moigos towns on the Skraigos have no meaningful sea access through Phylos Bay.

#### Western Approaches

Beyond Phylos Bay lies the open western sea — the Ocean of Elorinia, stretching toward distant lands. Ships heading west from Petrona Septia must navigate out of the bay's shallows before finding deep water, a process that takes hours and requires careful attention to the bottom.

The bay's mouth is marked by a series of rocky islets that provide some protection from storms but also narrow the entrance. In bad weather, the waves breaking over these rocks make the approach dangerous. Sensible captains wait for calmer conditions rather than risk the bay entrance in a storm.

#### Isolation

Phylos Bay's shallows contribute to Petrona Septia's isolation from maritime trade. The island's position should make it a useful waypoint for ships traveling the western Seacleft Coast, but the difficulty of actually reaching its ports discourages most traffic. Merchants prefer routes that don't require lightering cargo through a silted bay.

This isolation was less significant when Ios's stone dolls made overland transport practical. Now that the dolls are failing, Phylos Bay's limitations are becoming a genuine problem. Ios needs to trade but can't easily get goods to market; the shallow harbor that never mattered when dolls carried everything now matters very much indeed.

### Rilyn

Tags: state, citystate, nation

A city-state on Petrona Septia Island in the Seacleft Coast region. Located north/northeast of Ios and southeast of Moigos, Rilyn sits within the forest of Puma Wood on the northeastern side of the Screech Peaks (Ios lies on the southwestern side of the range).

Home to the Splinkreen — woodland people whose souls were transplanted from mighty trees into humanoid forms. Their bark-like skin ranges from smooth birch white to rough oak brown, and the forested environment of Puma Wood suits them perfectly.

#### Puma Wood

The forest that contains and defines Rilyn, spreading across the northeastern slopes of the Screech Peaks and down toward the Fernius Sound coast. Puma Wood is old-growth forest — massive trees that have stood for centuries, their canopy creating a green twilight below. The Splinkreen have lived here since their transformation, building their city among the trees rather than clearing them.

The forest is named for the large cats that once hunted here, though the pumas are rarely seen now. Whether they've retreated deeper into the woods or simply grown more cautious around the Splinkreen is unclear. The name persists regardless.

#### The City

Rilyn is built vertically rather than horizontally. Platforms and walkways connect the great trees, with structures built into the trunks and branches rather than on cleared ground. The forest floor is left largely undisturbed — the Splinkreen prefer to live above, in the canopy where the light is better and the connection to living wood more immediate.

The city has no walls, no gates, no clear boundary between settlement and forest. It simply becomes denser as you approach the center — more platforms, more walkways, more Splinkreen moving through the branches. Visitors who expect a conventional city find Rilyn disorienting; those who accept it on its own terms find it beautiful.

The population is small by human standards — perhaps a few thousand Splinkreen. Their long lives (three centuries or more) and slow reproduction keep numbers stable but low. The city could hold more if it needed to. It doesn't.

#### Culture

The Splinkreen are a strange people by human reckoning. Their souls were once trees — ancient, patient, unconcerned with the urgencies that drive shorter-lived beings. Transplanted into humanoid forms, they retain something of that perspective. They move slowly. They speak deliberately. They view death without fear, seeing it as a return to the earth rather than an ending.

This makes them difficult trading partners, poor allies in urgent situations, and confusing neighbors. The Splinkreen don't refuse to engage with outsiders — they simply engage on their own timeline, which rarely matches anyone else's. A negotiation that would take humans a day might take Splinkreen a month. They don't see the problem.

What the Splinkreen value: the forest, their community, the accumulated wisdom of their long lives. What they don't value: urgency, acquisition, the constant striving that characterizes human societies. Rilyn is a place of contemplation, not ambition.

#### Relations

The Splinkreen maintain correct relations with their neighbors without being deeply involved with any of them. They trade what they must, share information when asked politely, and otherwise keep to their forest.

**With Ios**: Curiosity more than commerce. The Splinkreen find the stone doll crisis philosophically interesting — a culture that created servants to avoid work, now forced to rediscover how to work. Some Splinkreen scholars have visited Todakres to study the dolls. Their conclusions, if any, they keep to themselves.

**With Moigos**: Minimal contact. The Kappa have nothing the Splinkreen want, and the Splinkreen have nothing worth the Kappa's manipulation. The two peoples ignore each other with mutual satisfaction.

**With outsiders**: Rilyn receives occasional visitors — scholars studying the Splinkreen, merchants hoping to find unique goods, travelers seeking the Eastern Traverse through the Screech Peaks. The Splinkreen are hospitable in their fashion, offering shelter and guidance. They just take their time about it.

### Ripmaw Sound

Tags: sea, geography, hazard

The western waters between Iqes and the Upoceax mainland, Ripmaw Sound earned its name from the volcanic rock formations that lurk beneath its surface. Ships that stray from the known channels find their hulls ripped open by jagged basalt ridges invisible until the moment of impact.

The sound is navigable — generations of Qindo sailors have mapped safe passages through its dangers — but the channels shift. Volcanic activity continues deep below, slowly raising new ridges and collapsing old ones. Charts more than a decade old are unreliable. Charts from outsiders are worthless.

#### The Ripmaw Ridges

Unlike the crystalline formations of the Shardmaw Isles or the dramatic spires of the Golem's Teeth, the Ripmaw ridges are insidious. Dark volcanic rock, often covered with seaweed and barnacles, sits just below the waterline — invisible in anything but the calmest, clearest conditions. A ship can sail over a ridge a hundred times safely, then catch it wrong on the hundred-and-first passage when the tide is slightly lower or the hull sits slightly deeper.

The ridges run roughly north-south in parallel lines, remnants of ancient lava flows that cooled into razor-sharp formations. The safe channels wind between them in patterns that seem random but follow the geological logic of the seafloor. Qindo pilots learn these patterns as children; outsiders learn them the hard way.

#### Navigation

Passage through Ripmaw Sound requires either a local pilot or extraordinary luck. The Qindo villages along the Ntando coast produce pilots who hire out to foreign vessels — one of the few reliable sources of outside income for the traditional communities. These pilots are well-paid and well-respected, even by the foreign elite in Mjiqa who otherwise dismiss Ntando as backwards.

The piloting tradition is closely guarded. Routes are taught within families, passed from parent to child through years of apprenticeship. Attempts to chart the sound systematically have failed; the channels shift too frequently, and the pilots have no interest in making their knowledge obsolete.

#### The Cast Cays

Scattered through the northern reaches of Ripmaw Sound, the Cast Cays are a loose collection of small islands — volcanic remnants too small or poor for permanent settlement. The name refers to their scattered, cast-off appearance, as if a giant had thrown handfuls of rock into the sea.

The cays serve several purposes:
- **Emergency shelter** for ships caught in storms or needing repairs
- **Fishing camps** during seasonal runs
- **Smuggler hideouts** for those who'd rather not dock in proper ports
- **Exile** for those who've made enemies and need to disappear

No one governs the Cast Cays. No one claims them. They exist in the margins, useful precisely because they're ignored.

#### What Lives Below

Sailors who work Ripmaw Sound speak of things in the water — shapes glimpsed in the murk, impacts against hulls that weren't rocks, crews that vanished from anchored ships without explanation. Most attribute these stories to the sound's genuine dangers and the human tendency to invent monsters. The ridges are threat enough without adding creatures.

But the old Qindo pilots pour offerings into certain waters and avoid certain channels regardless of the tide. They say the sound has moods, and a wise sailor learns to read them. What creates those moods — currents, pressure, or something with intentions — they decline to specify.

The wrecks that litter the seafloor between the ridges attract scavengers. Some of those scavengers are fish. Some are larger. The pilots know which wrecks to avoid, and they don't explain why.

### Scatter Sound

Tags: sea, geography

The body of water between the Eskiloko coast, the Tyvern Isles, and the Isle of the Night. Named for the countless small islands, rocks, and reefs scattered across its surface, Scatter Sound is a maze of hazards and hiding places that rewards local knowledge and punishes overconfidence.

The sound isn't deep — much of it can be waded at low tide if you know where to step. This makes it navigable for small craft but treacherous for larger vessels, whose keels find the bottom unexpectedly. The scattered islands break up waves and currents, creating calm patches next to sudden turbulence.

#### The Scattered Islands

Dozens of islands dot the sound, ranging from bare rocks that barely break the surface to forested islets large enough to camp on. None support permanent settlement — they're too small, too exposed, or too frequently submerged — but they serve countless temporary purposes.

**Fishing camps** appear seasonally when particular species run through the sound. Fishermen from both Tuktuk villages and Eskiloko settlements work these waters, maintaining an uneasy coexistence based on tradition and practicality. Certain islands are "Tuktuk rocks" and others are "mainland stones," divisions everyone knows but no one officially acknowledges.

**Smuggler caches** hide among the islands. The sound's complexity makes it ideal for stashing goods away from official eyes — whatever "official" means in a region where the Kappa run everything that matters. Small boats can weave through channels that larger patrol vessels can't follow, dropping cargo on islands that look identical to the uninitiated.

**Meeting points** for those who don't want to be seen meeting. The islands provide neutral ground between factions, private spaces for negotiations that can't happen in town, and convenient locations for exchanges that benefit from witnesses being absent.

#### The Gloomterror Approach

The western reaches of Scatter Sound border the Isle of the Night, where the Gloomterror Forest's unnatural darkness bleeds into the water. Sailors report that the boundary isn't sharp — you don't sail from normal water into supernatural shadow. Instead, the light dims gradually, colors fade, and by the time you realize something is wrong, you're deeper in than you meant to go.

The islands nearest the Isle of the Night are avoided. They sit in permanent twilight even at noon, and the things that wash up on their shores aren't always identifiable. Fishermen who work the western sound learn exactly how far they can go — and they don't go farther.

#### Navigation

Working Scatter Sound requires either intimate local knowledge or a willingness to move slowly and sound constantly. The channels between islands shift with storms and seasons; what was passable last month may ground you today. Both Tuktuk and Eskiloko pilots know the sound's moods, and hiring one is the only safe way for outsiders to traverse it.

The alternative is going around — south through Winzy Strait or north past the Tyvern Isles. Most merchant traffic takes these longer routes rather than risk the sound's hazards. Only locals, smugglers, and the desperate thread their way through the scattered islands.

#### Tensions

Scatter Sound is contested water in the sense that everyone uses it and no one controls it. The Tuktuk consider it part of their ancestral territory. The Kappa consider it part of their operational area. Neither group has the ability or desire to enforce exclusive control, so both tolerate the other's presence while maintaining the option to cause problems if needed.

The result is a working peace punctuated by incidents. A Tuktuk fishing boat cuts the nets of an Eskiloko competitor. A smuggler cache is raided by persons unknown. A meeting on a neutral island ends in violence. These events rarely escalate — everyone benefits too much from the sound's usefulness to let any single dispute poison the whole arrangement — but the potential for escalation keeps everyone careful.

### Screech Peaks

Tags: mountains, geography

A jagged mountain range running roughly northeast to southwest across Petrona Septia Island, dividing the landmass into distinct regions. Ios occupies the southwestern slopes, Rilyn nestles in the Puma Wood on the northeastern side, and Moigos spreads across the lowlands to the north. The peaks are not especially tall — none reach above the treeline for more than a few hundred feet — but they're steep, broken, and difficult to traverse.

The name comes from the creatures that inhabit the upper reaches: flying predators whose hunting calls echo across the peaks at night. The sound is distinctive — a rising shriek that carries for miles — and gives the mountains their grim reputation.

#### The Screechers

The creatures that give the peaks their name are a species of large, bat-like predators that hunt by night. They're roughly the size of a large dog, with leathery wings spanning eight to ten feet, and they hunt in packs of three to seven individuals. Their shrieking calls serve multiple purposes: echolocation for navigation, communication between pack members, and — most disturbingly — terror tactics against prey.

The screechers hunt goats, deer, and anything else they can carry. They've been known to attack humans, particularly lone travelers caught in the high passes after dark. Deaths are rare but not unknown. The standard advice for crossing the Screech Peaks is simple: travel by day, find shelter before sunset, and don't make camp in the open.

The creatures are most active in the upper elevations, above where the forest thins. The lower slopes and passes are relatively safe, which is why Todakres could be built against the mountains without constant predation. But anyone venturing higher — prospectors, hunters, travelers taking the difficult routes — must contend with the screechers.

#### Geography

The Screech Peaks formed from volcanic activity in the distant past, though no active volcanism remains. The rock is dark basalt in most places, with occasional veins of lighter stone and mineral deposits that have attracted prospectors over the centuries. The mountains trap moisture from the eastern winds, creating wetter conditions on the Rilyn side (where Puma Wood grows) and drier terrain on the Ios side.

The range contains three significant passes:

**The Calentia Pass** — The primary route between Moigos and Ios, connecting the town of Calentia to the upper Dipindre valley. This is the easiest crossing, relatively low and well-maintained, used by most legitimate traffic between the states.

**The Eastern Traverse** — A higher, more difficult route connecting the Nioplenese valley to the approaches to Rilyn. Rarely used except by those specifically traveling to or from the Splinkreen city-state.

**The Shepherd's Path** — A series of connected trails through the middle elevations, used by those who graze animals in the mountain meadows. Not a true pass, but knowledgeable locals can use it to cross the range if necessary.

#### The Peaks and Ios

Todakres is built against the southwestern slopes of the Screech Peaks, using the mountains for defense and the rivers that flow from them for water. The relationship is ambivalent — the mountains protect Ios from easy invasion but also limit its connections to the rest of Petrona Septia.

The quarries at Petras are located in the foothills, extracting stone from the mountains for construction. The specialized stone once used for the stone dolls allegedly came from a specific deposit higher in the peaks, now exhausted — though some believe undiscovered veins remain in the more remote areas.

#### The Peaks and Rilyn

The northeastern slopes of the Screech Peaks are gentler, descending into the Puma Wood where Rilyn is located. The Splinkreen have little reason to venture into the high peaks — their culture is oriented toward forests, not mountains — but they maintain the trails through their territory and occasionally guide travelers to the Eastern Traverse.

#### Dangers

Beyond the screechers, the Screech Peaks present standard mountain hazards: unstable slopes, sudden weather changes, difficult terrain, and the simple danger of getting lost in unfamiliar country. The passes are safe enough for experienced travelers in good weather. The higher elevations are dangerous for anyone.

Rumors persist of other things in the peaks — ruins from before any current settlement, cave systems that descend into darkness, creatures stranger than the screechers. Whether these stories are true or simply the embellishments that accumulate around any wild place, the Screech Peaks remain largely unexplored above the treeline.

### Shredwreck

Tags: shipwreck, poi, salvage

The scattered remains of the *Golden Sovereignty*, a treasure galleon that went down in the waters near the Golem's Teeth three generations ago. Unlike most shipwrecks, Shredwreck isn't a single location — the ship was torn apart by the rocks and currents, its cargo scattered across more than a mile of seafloor in dozens of separate debris fields.

The treasure is real. The *Golden Sovereignty* was carrying the accumulated wealth of a failed merchant house — a final desperate voyage to relocate their fortune before creditors could seize it. Gold, silver, gems, trade goods, and reportedly several items of magical significance went down with the ship. Enough has been recovered over the decades to prove the stories true. Enough remains to keep treasure hunters coming.

#### The Wreck

The *Golden Sovereignty* struck the Golem's Teeth during a storm, trying to thread a passage that experienced captains avoid even in calm weather. The ship didn't sink cleanly — it was shredded, hence the name, torn apart by successive impacts as currents drove it through the rock formations.

The main hull lies in perhaps sixty feet of water, broken into three major sections. The bow wedged between two tooth-like spires; the midsection settled on a sandy shelf; the stern was never found intact, only fragments scattered across the deeper water to the east. Between these sections, smaller debris fields mark where cargo spilled as the ship broke apart.

#### Salvage Operations

Shredwreck has been worked continuously since its discovery. The early years saw a fortune recovered — gold bars, coin chests, the easily accessible cargo. What remains is harder to reach: items buried under collapsed timbers, cargo that settled in the deeper debris fields, the mysterious stern section that may have held the most valuable goods.

The salvage trade has its own economy. Licensed salvagers pay fees to the ring-holders in Mjiqa for exclusive rights to specific debris fields. Unlicensed salvagers work the margins, risking fines or worse if caught. Diving crews hire out their skills; equipment suppliers profit regardless of who finds treasure; and the town of Blackpoint exists entirely to service the operation.

Fortunes have been made here. More fortunes have been lost — spent on equipment, fees, and living expenses while searching for treasure that was already found or never existed. The salvage economy runs on hope as much as gold.

#### The Debris Fields

**The Bow Section**: Wedged between two rock spires, accessible only at certain tides. The captain's quarters were here; whatever he kept closest has likely been recovered, but the rocks make systematic searching difficult.

**The Midsection**: The most thoroughly salvaged area. The main cargo hold was here, and most of the confirmed treasure came from this section. Salvagers still work it, convinced that sealed compartments or hidden caches remain.

**The Stern Debris**: Scattered across deeper water, harder to reach, less thoroughly searched. The ship's strong room was supposedly in the stern — the most secure compartment, where the most valuable cargo would have been kept. No one has found it. Either it was destroyed completely, or it lies somewhere in the debris field, waiting.

**The Deep Scatter**: Beyond the main debris fields, individual items carried by currents into deeper water. Occasional finds here suggest more remains to be discovered, but searching the open seafloor is nearly impossible.

#### Blackpoint

The salvage town that grew up to service Shredwreck sits on a volcanic headland overlooking the wreck site. The "point" is black basalt, jutting into waters that are dangerous on calm days and deadly in storms.

Blackpoint is rough, transient, and lawless. No ring-holders bother claiming it; no garrison keeps order. The town exists because treasure hunters need somewhere to sleep, eat, buy equipment, and spend their earnings (or borrow against future finds). Disputes are settled privately. Credit is extended at ruinous rates. Fortunes change hands in back-room deals.

The permanent population is small — merchants, tavern-keepers, equipment suppliers, and the sort of people who profit from desperation. The transient population fluctuates with the seasons and the rumors; a credible story of new treasure discovered can double the town's size in a week.

#### Dangers

The waters around Shredwreck are dangerous for the same reasons that sank the *Golden Sovereignty*. The Golem's Teeth don't forgive carelessness, and salvage operations require working in close proximity to the rocks that kill ships.

Diving itself carries risks — the depths involved push the limits of breath-holding, currents can trap divers against wreckage, and the debris is unstable. Collapses have killed salvagers. So have encounters with whatever lives in the deeper water.

And then there's the human danger. Salvagers guard their claims jealously. Theft of recovered treasure is common. Violence over particularly valuable finds is not unknown. Blackpoint's lack of law means disputes escalate quickly, and bodies occasionally join the wreckage on the seafloor.

#### Rumors

The wreck has accumulated legends over the generations:

**The Strong Room**: The ship's most secure compartment, supposedly containing items too valuable to store in the main hold. No one has found it. Some believe it lies in the unsearched stern debris; others think it was ejected during the breakup and lies somewhere in the deep scatter; a few claim it was never on the ship at all.

**The Merchant's Ghost**: The head of the failed house reportedly went down with his fortune. Divers occasionally report seeing a figure in outdated clothing watching them from the murk, always just at the edge of visibility, always gone when approached.

**The Cursed Cargo**: Something in the hold wasn't gold or silver. Something the merchant house was transporting for someone else, something that may have caused the storm that sank them. Salvagers who find the wrong item don't always surface.

### Starfish Isles

Tags: island, geography, fishing

A sprawling archipelago of low-lying islands, sandbars, and reef systems stretching north of Enavadi into open water. The Starfish Isles take their name from the vast colonies of brilliantly colored starfish that cling to every submerged surface—orange, crimson, and gold creatures whose pigments form the foundation of Linas's dye trade.

The isles are less a coherent landmass than a maze of shallow tidal flats, partially submerged reefs, and sandy spits that appear and disappear with the tides. Deep-draft vessels cannot navigate here; only flat-bottomed harvesting boats and small fishing craft can work these waters safely. This natural barrier has kept the isles largely uninhabited despite their economic value.

#### The Harvesting Grounds

The shallow waters of the Starfish Isles contain the richest shellfish beds on the Seacleft Coast. Starfish, snails, and clams grow here in extraordinary concentrations, their shells saturated with the orange and crimson pigments that make Linas dye famous across Alaria. Hundreds of Linas harvesting ships work these waters daily during the warm seasons, their crews diving to collect shellfish by hand or dragging specialized nets across the sandy bottom.

Linas claims exclusive harvesting rights to the isles, enforced by armed dye-guild vessels that patrol the major channels. In practice, the waters are too vast and the channels too numerous for complete control. Poachers—independent harvesters, Mirko-affiliated smugglers, and opportunistic fishermen from a dozen ports—work the edges of the grounds constantly. The guild ships catch perhaps one in ten, and the fines are simply a cost of doing business.

#### The Tide-Singers

On the outermost isles, where the Starfish Isles give way to the deep water of the Walker Depths, a small religious order maintains a scattering of weathered shrines. The Tide-Singers—never more than a few dozen souls—believe that the drowned dead who walk the seafloor below are ancestors trapped between worlds, unable to pass on because they died without proper rites.

The Tide-Singers perform ceremonies at the turning of tides, singing names into the water to "release" specific dead. Whether the rituals work is a matter of faith. What's certain is that desperate families sometimes make the journey to the outer isles, paying the Singers to call for a lost relative. The Singers accept no coin—only objects that belonged to the deceased, which they weight with stones and drop into the depths.

Most Linas harvesters consider the Tide-Singers harmless eccentrics, tolerated because they harm no one and occasionally provide shelter to boats caught in sudden storms. A few old salts speak of them differently—claiming the waters near the shrines are calmer, that the walking dead below give those places a wide berth. The Singers themselves say nothing either way.

#### The Walker Depths

The deep channel between the Starfish Isles and the coast of Mueras to the west contains the Walker Depths—waters where the drowned dead walk the seafloor in endless, silent procession. Fishermen avoid these waters not from physical danger (the walkers rarely surface) but from unease. On still nights, lights can be seen moving below the surface, and weighted lines sometimes come up tangled in ways that suggest grasping hands.

The Tide-Singers believe these are the restless dead of shipwrecks past, trapped by improper burial. Scholars in Linas theorize it's some form of necromantic current or planar bleed. Whatever the truth, wise captains chart their courses around the Depths rather than through them.

#### Navigation and Hazards

The Starfish Isles are navigable only by those who know them. Channels shift with storms and seasons; sandbars that were passable last month may ground a boat today. Linas pilots train for years before earning certification to guide vessels through the major routes, and even they refuse to work unfamiliar channels without local guides.

Beyond the navigational challenges, the outer isles border genuinely dangerous waters. To the west lie the Walker Depths. To the northwest, the approaches to Mueras and the Labyrinth Sound. Ships that stray too far from the harvesting grounds may find themselves in waters where the hazards are more than geographical.

### Torguli Islands

Tags: island, geography

A long, curving chain of islands stretching southwest from the main Tyvern archipelago into open water. The Torguli Islands arc across perhaps a hundred miles of sea, each island visible from the next, forming a natural pathway that sailors have followed since before recorded history.

The islands are uninhabited in any permanent sense. They're too small, too exposed, and too far from the resources needed for sustained settlement. But their chain-like arrangement makes them invaluable for navigation — following the Torguli will take you southwest toward deeper waters, and each island serves as a waypoint confirming you're still on course.

#### Character

The islands share a common character: low, rocky, wind-scoured. Vegetation is sparse — salt-tolerant grasses, scrub bushes, the occasional twisted tree that's learned to grow nearly horizontal. Fresh water is scarce; some islands have brackish pools that collect rainfall, but most offer nothing drinkable.

Seabirds nest here in enormous numbers. The islands' isolation and lack of ground predators make them ideal breeding grounds, and during nesting season the rocks are covered with birds and the air filled with their calls. Egg-collectors sometimes make the journey out, but the birds defend their nests aggressively, and the trip rarely proves worth the effort.

#### Uses

**Navigation**: The primary value of the Torguli Islands is showing the way. Sailors heading southwest use them as stepping stones, each island confirming position and providing a landmark for the next leg. Heading northeast, the chain guides travelers back toward the Tyvern Isles and the inhabited waters beyond.

**Temporary shelter**: Ships caught by weather can anchor in the lee of the larger islands, waiting out storms in relative safety. The islands don't offer much, but they break the wind and waves enough to make the difference between riding out a storm and being swamped.

**Disappearing**: The Torguli Islands offer privacy for those who need it. Smugglers cache goods here; fugitives hide between the rocks; people who need to meet without witnesses find the isolation convenient. The chain is long enough and the islands numerous enough that someone who wants to lose themselves can do so effectively.

#### The Outer Islands

The southwestern end of the chain trails off into increasingly scattered rocks, eventually disappearing into open water. The outermost islands are rarely visited — too far from anything useful, too exposed to weather, too empty of resources. Sailors who've gone that far report that the final islands are little more than wave-washed rocks, barely above the waterline.

Beyond the chain's end lies the Floating Islands of Aleve Akribus, visible on clear days as distant shapes that hang in the air rather than resting on the water. Some believe the Torguli Islands once extended all the way to Aleve Akribus, and that the floating islands are simply the chain's continuation — lifted into the sky by forces unknown.

#### Local Knowledge

The Tuktuk don't claim the Torguli Islands the way they claim the main Tyvern archipelago, but they know them better than anyone. Tuktuk fishermen and raiders have used the chain for generations, and their villages hold accumulated knowledge of each island — which have water, which offer shelter, which are treacherous despite appearing safe.

This knowledge isn't shared freely. Outsiders who want to traverse the Torguli can hire Tuktuk guides, but the guides show only what's necessary for the immediate journey. The chain's secrets remain with those who've earned them through years of experience.

### Tyvern Isles

Tags: island, geography, tuktuk

A group of islands off the Seacleft Coast, home to the Tuktuk people. The islands are dominated by dense jungle and mysterious ruins, with settlements clustered along the coasts and rivers where the turtle-folk have built their warrior culture over generations.

The Tuktuk claim these islands as their ancestral territory — not by ancient occupation but by conquest and settlement within recorded history. Whatever peoples lived here before the Tuktuk arrived left only ruins behind. The turtle-folk found the islands, fought for them, and made them their own.

#### Tuktuk Villages

The Tuktuk organize themselves by clan and village, each settlement a defensive holdfast centered on extended family groups. Villages are built to withstand assault — thick walls, choke-point approaches, communal structures that can shelter the entire population during attacks. The architecture reflects a people who expect to fight for what they have.

Eight major villages dot the Tyvern Isles:

**Nkoko** — Northernmost village, closest to the Tower of Gwyndar. The warriors of Nkoko consider themselves guardians of the ancient fortress, though they guard it from outside rather than within. Known for producing scouts and rangers who know the jungle paths intimately. When outsiders ask too many questions about the tower, Nkoko's elders are the ones who decide whether to answer.

**Mtrako** — Eastern coastal village and the primary seafaring settlement. Shipwrights work here, building the sturdy vessels the Tuktuk use for fishing, raiding, and trade. Mtrako's warriors are the most likely to interact with outsiders — they raid foreign shipping and occasionally engage in legitimate commerce. The village maintains a rough harbor where non-Tuktuk ships can anchor, though visitors should expect close observation.

**Iiunas** — Interior village deep in the forested hills. The Tuktuk here are hunters and trackers who work the deep jungle. They maintain the paths between villages, know which routes are safe and which have become dangerous, and keep the forest's threats in check. When something comes out of the jungle that shouldn't, Iiunas deals with it.

**Unu** — Small village positioned between the coast and interior, serving as a waypoint and trading post between the seafaring and forest-dwelling clans. Marriages between coastal and interior families often happen here, and the village has developed a reputation for diplomacy — by Tuktuk standards, which still involves formal duels but with more negotiation beforehand.

**Trokos** — Eastern settlement known for metalworkers and crafters. The forges of Trokos produce weapons and armor prized across the Tyvern Isles, working imported metals into blades that hold edges through brutal use. Trokos smiths are respected throughout Tuktuk society, and young warriors from other villages often serve apprenticeships here.

**Minos** — Southern village near the Ribwood Forest, primary defenders against logging expeditions. These Tuktuk have perfected forest ambush tactics, making the cost of unauthorized ribwood harvesting extremely high. They're fiercer and more hostile to outsiders than most Tuktuk — too many have watched their homeland ravaged by foreign profiteers.

**Ugna** — Central village that often hosts clan councils and major duels. The closest thing the Tuktuk have to a capital, though they'd reject that term — no single village rules the others. When decisions affecting all Tuktuk must be made, representatives gather at Ugna. When champions must settle disputes that affect multiple clans, they fight at Ugna. The village maintains neutral ground and sacred dueling circles.

**Mkoto** — Southwest village, closest to the waters facing the Torguli Islands. Watchers here monitor the southern and western approaches, noting what ships pass through Winzy Strait and what movements occur among the outer islands. They're the first to know if something unusual approaches from the direction of Aleve Akribus.

**Vitruk** — Coastal village facing Scatter Sound, the primary contact point with Moigos. Trading happens here despite cultural tensions — the Tuktuk need some goods they can't produce, and the Kappa's networks can provide them. The relationship isn't friendly, but it's practical. Vitruk's elders have learned to deal with the toad-folk crime lords without being consumed by their webs of debt and obligation.

#### Jungles of Tyvern

The interior of the Tyvern Isles is covered in thick tropical jungle, dangerous and wild. The Tuktuk have cleared areas around their villages and maintain paths between settlements, but the deep jungle remains untamed — home to predators, ruins, and things the turtle-folk prefer to avoid.

##### Tower of Gwyndar

An ancient fortress deep in the jungles, visible above the canopy, serving as a landmark that sailors use for navigation even as they avoid approaching. The Tower of Gwyndar sits at the intersection of Dark and Void leylines — a nexus of shadow and emptiness that predates memory.

The tower is black stone, seamless, with no visible mortar or joints. The architecture is wrong — doorways too tall, stairs with uneven risings, rooms that seem larger inside than outside. Whoever built it wasn't human-sized, and they weren't thinking in human ways. The Tuktuk found it when they settled these islands; they didn't build it. No one knows who did.

The leyline intersection creates *absence*. Within the tower, shadows are deeper than they should be. Sounds don't carry. Memories fade. Visitors who stay too long find themselves forgetting why they came, what they were looking for, who they are.

The Nkoko village considers themselves guardians, but "guardian" means keeping things from coming *out*. They don't enter except in dire need, and those who do enter don't always return unchanged. Expeditions from outside occasionally try to explore; the Tuktuk warn them once, then let the tower handle the problem.

##### Black Forest

Located in the jungles near the Tower of Gwyndar, the Black Forest is an unnatural place where nearly all color has been drained away. Your shadow can leave your body here, becoming separated and wandering independently — a deeply unsettling phenomenon that can result in permanent loss of one's shadow.

Large ogres that have lost their shadows live in this forest, hunting by the absence of light rather than its presence. The forest is extremely dangerous, as those who lose their shadows often lose part of their essence, becoming hollow and susceptible to possession by shadow entities.

#### Southern Tyvern

The southern islands of the Tyvern archipelago feature different terrain and resources from the central jungles.

##### Ribwood Forest

A forest on the southern Tyvern Islands, home to a rare and valuable tree species known as ribwood. This remarkable wood is completely fireproof — it doesn't burn under any circumstances, making it incredibly valuable for shipbuilding. Wealthy merchants and pirates prize ribwood vessels above all others, as they're immune to fire arrows, Greek fire, and the countless other flame-based hazards of naval warfare.

However, harvesting ribwood comes at a cost. The Tuktuk people live in and around the Ribwood Forest, and they fiercely resent outsiders who ravage their homeland for profit. Logging expeditions into the forest frequently end in violence, with Tuktuk warriors — particularly those from Minos village — ambushing the loggers. Despite the danger, the lure of fireproof ships ensures that treasure-seekers continue to risk the Tuktuk's wrath to harvest the precious wood.

### Winzy Strait

Tags: sea, geography

A narrow passage of water at the southern end of the Tyvern island chain, separating the archipelago from the lands to the south. The strait is named for an old word meaning "wind-path" — the passage funnels air currents into unpredictable gusts that make sailing tricky and swimming inadvisable.

Winzy Strait sees little traffic. No major trade routes pass through it; the waters lead to regions that generate neither significant exports nor demand for imports. Ships that use the strait are typically local fishing vessels, Tuktuk boats moving between their islands, or the occasional traveler who specifically wants to reach somewhere that most people don't go.

#### Character

The strait is unremarkable in most respects — deep enough for navigation, free of the hazards that plague Scatter Sound, lacking the supernatural dangers of the Isle of the Night's approaches. Its main challenge is the wind, which accelerates through the narrow passage and shifts direction without warning. Sailors who know the strait time their crossings carefully; those who don't find themselves fighting crosswinds that turn a simple passage into exhausting work.

The shores on both sides are sparsely populated. The southern Tyvern islands hold a few Tuktuk villages that watch the strait more from habit than necessity. The mainland coast to the south is... quiet. Whatever lies in that direction doesn't attract attention or visitors.

#### Blink Creek

A coastal stream empties into the strait from the mainland side, notable for its peculiar behavior. The current reverses unpredictably — flowing seaward one moment, inland the next — as if the creek "blinks" and changes its mind about which direction water should flow.

Local fishermen have learned the creek's rhythms, though "rhythm" implies more regularity than exists. The reversals follow no obvious pattern tied to tides, weather, or time of day. Theories range from underground connections to other water sources, to pressure differentials in caverns below, to something magical influencing the flow.

The creek itself is unremarkable — shallow, narrow, useful for freshwater if you're passing by. But visitors find the current reversals disconcerting, especially when they happen mid-crossing and suddenly you're fighting the water instead of riding it.

#### Isolation

Winzy Strait's lack of strategic or commercial importance has left it largely ignored by the powers that contest other waterways in the region. The Tuktuk don't patrol it heavily; the Kappa have no interest in it; no one fights over passage rights because no one particularly wants to pass through.

This isolation has its own value. The strait is useful precisely because no one watches it. People who want to move without being noticed, who want to reach places without explaining why, who want to leave the more trafficked waters behind — they use Winzy Strait. Not in numbers large enough to matter, but steadily enough that the local Tuktuk have learned not to ask questions about the occasional unfamiliar boat.

## Farlands

The Farlands occupy the western coastal region of Upoceax—a vast stretch of land running nearly 600 miles from north to south. Despite its size, civilization clings only to the southern reaches. The northern two-thirds of the region is empty wilderness: uninhabited mountains, trackless forests, and lonely coastline.

### Geography

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Troikan Strait separates the Farlands from the Seacliff Coast islands
- **East**: The Kelder Mountains, continuing south into the Mathavia range
- **South**: Transitions into Wycendeula
- **West**: Ocean of Elorinia

#### The Empty North

The northern Farlands are wilderness. The Sunset Mountains run along the western coast—a jagged, uninhabited range with no passes worth using and no settlements worth supplying. East of the mountains, the Butterfly Forest covers the lowlands, equally empty of permanent habitation.

The only exception is **Jeh Bli**, a Xi'ivrach orc city-state built on the shores of Lake Kro Nymos. It sits in complete isolation, hundreds of miles from the nearest civilization. Why the orcs settled here, and how they sustain themselves so far from anyone else, are questions the elves to the south have never bothered to answer.

The Troikan Strait to the north is unremarkable—just water separating the Farlands from Ios and the other Seacliff states. There's no meaningful trade through the strait; it's simply not on the way to anywhere.

#### The Three Elven Kingdoms

Civilization begins south of the Vokas Pendl mountains. Here, three elven polities share the more hospitable terrain, bound together by the Three Kingdoms Treaty signed at Laeroth Esori approximately 4,000 years ago:

**Lenora**: The agricultural heartland, occupying the fertile lowlands and coastal forests. A Landsmeet council of landholders governs; the kingdom serves as breadbasket for the confederation. Three great rivers—Kilgre Kevi, Kilgre Apnuk, and Kilgre Thovrys—water the territory. Largest population of the three kingdoms (~400,000).

**Illron**: The southernmost kingdom, following the old ways. Most of Illron's territory is Iyaklomori Grera—a vast forest that belongs to the fae under an ancient treaty. The elves live only on the edges: coastal settlements (A'valenor, Olymethemar, Hassera) connected by road, and eastern settlements (capital Ishla'Anore, E'lethelas) on the forest's margin. Smallest active territory despite considerable nominal borders.

**Deo Esari**: The mountain kingdom, occupying the Kelder range. Governed by the Titanic Priesthood, keepers of the titan bones buried throughout the peaks. Source of ~95% of the world's titan bone—material so sacred it never leaves the confederation except through defectors. The southern harvesting grounds were abandoned 200 years ago after a contamination disaster.

A fourth elven group, **Rakite**, occupies the plains east of the Kelder Mountains. They follow the buffalo herds, practice a gift-economy distinct from the settled kingdoms, and do not participate in the confederation. Trade with Rakite is formal but friendly.

#### Key Geographic Features

**Forests**:
- **Elorshianod**: Coastal forest of Lenora, settled and worked for timber and river-town life
- **Iyaklomori Grera**: Sacred forest of Illron, fae territory, no elven settlement permitted
- **Amholia Greras**: Central forest between all three kingdoms, home to the fae court at Enera Savaci
- **Drakwald Forest**: Northern forest of Lenora, bordering the wilderness

**Mountains**:
- **Vokas Pendl**: Northern spur, source of the Kilgre Kevi
- **Kelder Mountains**: Bracket-shaped range along the eastern edge, titan bone territory
- **Mathavia Mountains**: Southern extension of the Kelder, including contaminated zones

**Rivers** (Lenora):
- **Kilgre Kevi**: Northern river, from Vokas Pendl through Elorshianod to coast
- **Kilgre Apnuk**: Central river with many tributaries, feeds capital Jien Asari
- **Kilgre Thovrys**: Southern river, feeds isolated port of Imyena Edhil

**Rivers** (Illron):
- **Kilgre Venora**: Northern river, one of two legal travel routes through fae territory
- **Ver Ta'Eres**: Central river, site of Kilren's Palace
- **Ver Suterela**: Southern river

#### The Confederation

The three kingdoms maintain a loose confederation, meeting at Laeroth Esori to coordinate on matters affecting all. The site is neutral ground—geometrically centered between the kingdoms—and has been enchanted over millennia to serve as one of the safest places in the world for diplomatic negotiation.

The confederation operates on a one-kingdom-one-voice principle: each polity sends four representatives (two men, two women) to deliberations. This arrangement favors Illron, which has the smallest population, and frustrates Lenora, which has the largest. Deo Esari typically sides with Illron on matters of tradition.

Rakite exists outside this system entirely. Jeh Bli, to the north, is simply too far away to matter.

### Notable Locations

#### Sacred and Dangerous Sites

**Laeroth Esori**: The confederation meeting ground in Amholia Greras. Enchanted over 4,000 years—truth-binding, memory preservation, violence dampening, weather control. Treaties made here are witnessed by the ancestors. One of the safest places in the world.

**Enera Savaci**: Heart of Amholia Greras. Home to the fae court and queen of the forest. No trails lead here—70 miles through trackless woods from the nearest settlement. Elves do not visit uninvited.

**Kilren's Palace**: Ruined fortress in Iyaklomori Grera. Built 3,000 years ago by King Kilren in defiance of the fae treaty. Ten thousand soldiers vanished overnight; the king returned mute and hollow. Contains the finest titan-bone armory ever assembled—untouched, because anyone who enters suffers Kilren's fate or worse.

**Imyena Edhil**: The City of the Grieving. Southern Lenora, accessible only by river or sea—no roads. Home to elves exiled for forgetting true names. Walled to keep inhabitants in, not enemies out.

#### The Abandoned Lands

The southern foothills of the Kelder Mountains—Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—were abandoned 200 years ago after titan-bone contamination spread through the harvesting villages. The settlements still stand, empty and intact. The priesthood maintains warning markers. No one knows if the contamination has faded.

### What Makes It Interesting

The Farlands are a study in restraint and consequence. Three ancient kingdoms bound by older oaths. A forest no one will settle because of what happened when they tried. Mountains full of treasure that kills those who handle it carelessly. A city of exiles no one can leave.

For players, the region offers:
- **Political intrigue** within the confederation's archaic voting disputes
- **Dungeon delving** into Kilren's Palace (if they're brave or foolish)
- **Mystery** in the abandoned southern villages and what contaminated them
- **Moral complexity** around the Grieving of Imyena Edhil
- **Faction play** between tradition-bound kingdoms with genuine disagreements

### What Will Go Wrong

- The succession question in Lenora is reaching a breaking point; some families are considering drastic action
- Defectors from Deo Esari are increasing as titan-bone prices rise worldwide
- Someone always eventually decides Kilren's treasure is worth the risk
- The contaminated lands may hold answers—or may hold something worse
- The fae queen at Enera Savaci has her own agenda, and the elves are not privy to it

### Amholia Greras

Tags: forest, fae, sacred

The central forest of the Farlands, positioned between all three elven kingdoms. Amholia Greras is fae territory—has been for longer than the elves have records. Unlike Iyaklomori Grera to the south, where no settlement is permitted, Amholia Greras allows elves to pass through and even to gather at designated sites. Non-elves are another matter entirely.

Amholia Greras occupies the lowlands between Lenora's Starluck Hills to the north, Illron's Poscuni Gretanu grasslands to the south, and the Kelder foothills to the east. The forest is dense, old-growth, and thoroughly inhabited by creatures that do not welcome uninvited guests.

Trails lead from each of the three elven capitals to Laeroth Esori, the confederation's meeting ground. These trails are maintained by the elves but exist at the fae's sufferance. Beyond the trails, the forest is trackless.

#### The Fae Presence

All variety of fae creatures dwell within Amholia Greras. Some are merely mischievous; others are genuinely dangerous. The forest operates on fae logic: hospitality is sacred, rudeness is punished, and outsiders who don't understand the rules suffer for their ignorance.

Elves are considered guests of a sort—tolerated, even protected, so long as they follow the ancient protocols. They stay on the trails. They don't take what isn't offered. They don't linger longer than necessary.

Non-elves have no such protection. Travelers who enter Amholia Greras uninvited are fair game for the forest's inhabitants. Some are merely tormented—led in circles, frightened by illusions, robbed of food and gear. Others are never seen again. The fae don't explain their criteria.

#### Enera Savaci

At the forest's heart, 70 miles from any settlement through trackless woods, lies Enera Savaci—seat of the fae court and home to the queen of the forest. No trails lead there. The elves do not visit.

What the fae do in their court, what the queen wants, what her relationship is with the elven confederation—these are questions the elves have learned not to ask. The arrangement works. The elves don't pry.

#### Laeroth Esori

The confederation's sacred meeting ground sits within Amholia Greras, at a site geometrically centered between the three capitals. Trails from Jien Asari, Ishla'Anore, and Thillesari converge here.

Laeroth Esori is covered in detail in its own entry. In brief: it is one of the safest places in the world, enchanted over millennia, where the ancestors witness all agreements.

#### For Adventurers

Amholia Greras is not a place to wander casually. Non-elven parties entering the forest should expect:
- Getting lost (the forest shifts for those without permission)
- Fae encounters (ranging from annoying to lethal)
- No help from the elves (who won't risk their relationship with the fae for outsiders)

If you must enter, bring offerings. Be unfailingly polite. Don't take anything. Don't stay past nightfall if you can help it. And understand that the fae may simply decide you don't leave.

### Butterfly Forest

Tags: forest, geography, wilderness

A vast woodland blanketing the lowlands between the Sunset Mountains and the Vokas Enrisikna range. The forest takes its name from the millions of butterflies that swarm beneath its canopy—an impossible profusion of color drifting between the ancient trees.

The butterflies are beautiful. The forest is not safe.

#### The Canopy

The Butterfly Forest is old-growth broadleaf, dominated by massive pale-barked trees the orcs call *veleth*—"ghost wood." The veleth grow two hundred feet tall or more, their crowns interlocking to form a continuous canopy that filters the sun into a dim green twilight. Little undergrowth survives in the perpetual shade; the forest floor is open, carpeted with decades of fallen leaves.

The butterflies are everywhere. Every color, every pattern, every size from thumbnail to handspan. They gather in clouds around certain trees, drift in lazy spirals through clearings, land on anything that holds still. The orcs say each butterfly carries a single memory from someone who died in the forest. They might be speaking metaphorically. They might not.

#### Why No One Settles

The Jeh Bli orcs enter the forest to hunt and gather, but they don't stay overnight. When asked why, they point to the butterflies and change the subject.

The forest provides abundantly—deer, boar, edible fungi, medicinal plants, timber—but no one has ever built a permanent camp beneath the veleth. Not the orcs. Not the elves, in all their centuries here. Not whoever came before.

The reason becomes clear to anyone who spends a night under the canopy. The butterflies don't sleep. After dark, they glow—faintly, softly, each one a drifting point of pale light. And they watch. Thousands of them, gathering around sleeping figures, landing on closed eyelids, brushing against lips. Those who wake find the butterflies scattering, innocent as sunlight.

Those who don't wake are found in the morning looking peaceful, looking rested, looking like they simply forgot to breathe.

It doesn't happen every night. It doesn't happen to everyone. But it happens often enough that the orcs learned not to sleep here, and whatever the elves know about it, they haven't shared.

#### The Veleth Trees

The ghost-barked veleth are the heart of the ecosystem. Their leaves feed caterpillars that become butterflies. Their sap draws insects that the butterflies drink. Their roots go deep—deeper than they should, given the soil—and in places the roots have surfaced, forming natural arches and chambers between the trees.

Cutting a veleth is forbidden among the Jeh Bli, though they harvest fallen timber readily enough. The taboo is practical, not religious: when a veleth is cut, the butterflies in that grove become agitated. They swarm the cutter. And then, according to the orcs, the cutter walks into the forest and doesn't walk out.

The veleth might be sapient. They might be connected to something beneath the forest. They might simply be unusual trees that happen to feed unusual butterflies. The orcs aren't curious enough to find out, and neither is anyone else who's seen what the butterflies can do.

#### Deeper In

Most hunting parties stay near the forest's edges, within a day's walk of open ground. Deeper in, the veleth grow larger, the canopy thicker, the light dimmer. The butterflies grow larger too—some as big as ravens, their wings patterned with shapes that almost look like faces.

At the forest's heart, according to orc hunters who've glimpsed it from distant rises, there's a clearing. The veleth circle it but don't enter. The clearing is full of butterflies—a solid mass of them, piled and drifting and layered on top of each other. What's beneath them, if anything, no one has seen.

The orcs call it *Kel-Vethris*: "the place where memory gathers." They don't go there. They strongly recommend no one else go there either.

### Carya Nairn

Tags: region, geography, ruins, contaminated, revenant

A small region in the southern Kelder foothills, between Eshbya Hills and Tomgryir Eror. Part of the contaminated zone abandoned 200 years ago. Notable for containing Yzre's Grave.

#### Geography

Carya Nairn is a single valley system with surrounding ridges. It was never heavily settled, but it contained important titan deposits that were being actively worked when the contamination spread.

#### The Contamination

Carya Nairn was evacuated along with the other southern sites. The region now sits within the larger quarantine zone, accessible only to authorized priesthood observation teams—and they don't stay long.

#### Yzre's Grave

The most notable location in Carya Nairn is Yzre's Grave—the burial site and eternal haunt of an ord goldminer who predates the elven harvesting operations.

Yzre arrived in these hills convinced they contained gold deposits. He spent his life's fortune searching. Found nothing. Grew bitter. Never left. When he died, the locals (then still living) buried him where he fell.

He rose as a revenant, still searching for gold that was never there. Still bitter about his failure. Still unwilling to accept that he wasted his life.

The contamination may have affected him—or revenants may be immune to whatever lingers here. Either way, Yzre still wanders Carya Nairn, and he's not friendly to visitors. He cannot be destroyed through conventional means. The priesthood's warning markers apply to him as much as to any other hazard.

#### Current State

Closed, like all the southern sites. Doubly hazardous due to Yzre's presence. Anyone entering Carya Nairn risks both the contamination and an encounter with a hostile, unkillable revenant who's had two centuries to grow more bitter.

The priesthood doesn't enter this region at all anymore. Observation is conducted from the ridgelines, at distance.

### Deo Esari

Tags: state, nation, elven, confederation, titans

The mountain kingdom, occupying the Kelder Mountains along the eastern edge of the Farlands. Governed by the Titanic Priesthood, keepers of the titan bones. Source of approximately 95% of the world's titan-bone supply.

For full political and cultural details, see the [Deo Esari state entry](../../nations_and_powers/states/Deo%20Esari.md).

#### Geography

Deo Esari occupies the bracket-shaped Kelder Mountain range and its southern extension, the Mathavia Mountains. The terrain is alpine—high peaks, narrow valleys, scattered settlements built near harvesting sites.

**Major Features:**

- **Kelder Mountains**: The entire range along the Farlands' eastern edge. Titan bones throughout.
- **Mathavia Mountains**: Southern extension, including contaminated zones.
- **The Abandoned Lands**: Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—southern foothills closed 200 years ago after the contamination disaster.

**Rivers:**

- **Ver Pyur**: Flows from Isyherius southward
- Various mountain streams feeding lowland rivers

#### Major Settlements

Deo Esari has cities and towns but relatively few villages—mountain living concentrates population:

- **Thillesari**: Capital, central Kelder range
- **Isyherius**: Northernmost city, source of Ver Pyur
- **Mysaneas**: Secondary administrative center
- **Leleth Serine**: Major harvesting hub
- **Ryhaneas, Eyslon, Iyathelneor**: Range settlements
- **Ulfe Alari**: Southernmost active settlement (above contaminated zone)

#### The Southern Disaster

Two centuries ago, contamination spread through the southern harvesting villages. The cause is sealed in priesthood archives; the effects were wasting sickness, children born wrong, death across generations. The southern sites—Eshbya Hills, Tomgryir Eror, Carya Nairn, Kirthdron Soytas—were evacuated and remain closed.

This disaster cut harvesting capacity by ~40%, driving worldwide titan-bone prices to unprecedented heights.

#### Character

Deo Esari is the most insular and tradition-bound of the three kingdoms. They guard the titan bones as sacred trust, forbid outsiders entirely, and hunt defectors relentlessly. The southern disaster only reinforced their conservatism.

### Drakwald Forest

Tags: forest, geography, rakite, dangerous

A dense woodland in the southwestern corner of Rakite, where the Tyror Weklis plains meet the Vokas Pendi foothills. The Rakiten don't enter it. They don't talk about why.

#### Character

The Drakwald is wrong in ways that are hard to articulate. The trees are ordinary enough—oak and ash and hornbeam, the same species that grow in scattered copses across the plains. But they grow too close together, their branches interlocking overhead to block the sky. The undergrowth is too thick, too tangled, too resistant to passage.

And it's quiet. The plains are full of sound—wind in the grass, bird calls, the distant rumble of herds. The Drakwald swallows noise. Step under those trees and the world goes silent, as if someone had stuffed cotton in your ears.

The Rakiten have a word for places like this: *weklis-void*, "sleeping emptiness." Locations where something used to be and isn't anymore, leaving a hole in the world. The Drakwald feels like a hole.

#### The Boundary

The forest edge is remarkably sharp. Grass grows right up to the treeline, then stops. There's no transition zone, no scattered saplings, no gradual thickening—just plains, then forest, as if someone had drawn a line.

Buffalo won't cross that line. Horses balk and refuse. Dogs whine and pull toward home. Even insects seem reluctant—the grasshoppers and beetles that fill the plains become sparse within a hundred yards of the trees.

The Rakiten respect these warnings. Their oral tradition includes half-remembered stories of hunters who followed wounded game into the Drakwald and never emerged. Not "died in the forest"—*never emerged*. Their trails simply ended at the treeline, as if they'd stepped into another world.

Some elders say the forest is a door to somewhere else. Others say it's a trap that looks like a door. No one suggests finding out which is true.

#### What's Inside

Unknown. The Rakiten prohibition against entering has held for generations, and outsiders who stumble across the Drakwald rarely care enough to explore.

From the edge, the forest floor is visible for perhaps fifty feet before the undergrowth blocks the view. It looks normal—leaf litter, fallen branches, the occasional mushroom cluster. But the light is wrong. Even on bright days, the interior is dim, the shadows too deep for the canopy overhead.

Rakiten scouts have reported seeing movement in those shadows. Not animals—nothing with a recognizable shape—just motion at the edge of perception, there when you look away and gone when you look back.

One scout claimed he heard voices. Not words—just the rhythm of speech, rising and falling, too faint to understand. He refused to say more, and he died that winter in an unrelated hunting accident. The elders noted the timing but drew no conclusions.

#### Theories

**The Rakiten View**: The Drakwald is *weklis-void*, a wound in the world where something was removed. What was removed, and by whom, is forbidden knowledge—or more likely, lost knowledge that the prohibition has reframed as forbidden.

**The Lenoran View**: The few elven scholars who've heard of the Drakwald dismiss it as superstition. Forests are forests. The Rakiten are primitive grassland dwellers who fear trees because they're unfamiliar. (No Lenoran has visited the Drakwald to confirm this assessment.)

**The Concerning View**: The Drakwald occupies the borderland between Rakite and Lenora, between the plains and the mountains, between the leyline of Light and the leyline of—something else. It might be a natural boundary phenomenon, a place where magical currents cancel each other out. It might be something that's supposed to stay in the forest, and the wrongness is what keeps it contained.

#### Why It Matters Now

The Roule colonists have been burning grassland. So far, they've stayed on the eastern peninsula, far from the Drakwald. But if they keep expanding westward—if they decide the forest is just timber waiting to be harvested—they might cut those trees.

The Rakiten elders have considered warning them. They've decided against it. If the halflings are foolish enough to enter the Drakwald, perhaps the problem will solve itself.

This might be wisdom. It might be cowardice. It might be the Rakiten's cultural aversion to confrontation preventing them from doing the right thing.

Or it might be that the Drakwald is just a forest, and generations of Rakiten have been afraid of their own shadows.

There's one way to find out. No one's volunteering.

### Ektolmni Grif

Tags: hills, geography, rakite

The transitional hill country between Vokas Enrisikna and the Tyror plains—broken terrain where the mountains give way to grassland in a tumble of ridges, draws, and rocky outcrops. "Ektolmni" means "fingers" in Rakiten; the hills reach out from the mountains like a hand grasping at the plains.

#### Character

The Ektolmni Grif is neither mountain nor prairie. The grass grows here, but shorter and sparser than on the plains. Trees cluster in sheltered draws. Streams cut unexpected valleys. The terrain changes every few hundred yards, a maze of elevation and vegetation that rewards those who know it and punishes those who don't.

The Rakiten use the hills for hunting—deer, elk, and mountain goats descend from Vokas Enrisikna, and the broken terrain makes stalking easier than on the open plains. But they don't camp here overnight. The hills have too many hiding places, too many blind approaches, too many ways for something to watch you without being seen.

#### The Edge Camps

During summer hunts, Rakiten parties establish temporary camps at the transition zone where the hills meet the plains—close enough to access the hunting grounds, far enough to maintain visibility. These camps shift year to year as game patterns change, but a few locations are used regularly enough to have acquired names.

**Grif's Mouth**: A gap where the Ver Kanis emerges from the hills onto the plains. Good water, good sight lines, bad memories—according to Rakiten oral tradition, a war party was ambushed here generations ago, and spirits still linger.

**The High Seat**: An elevated ridge with views across both the hills and the northern plains. Scouts use it to track herd movements. It's exposed and waterless, but the visibility is worth the discomfort.

#### What Watches

The Rakiten say the Ektolmni Grif is inhabited, though they're vague about what inhabits it. Not orcs—the Xi'ivrach stay on the far side of the mountains. Not animals—the wildlife here is unremarkable. Something else.

Hunting parties report being followed. They hear footsteps that stop when they stop. They find their campsites disturbed when they return to them. They glimpse movement on ridgelines that turns out to be nothing when they investigate.

Most dismiss it as nerves—the hills are disorienting, and the broken terrain plays tricks. But enough hunters have reported enough strange experiences that the tradition holds: hunt in the Ektolmni Grif, but don't stay past sunset.

### Enera Savaci

Tags: poi, fae, sacred

The heart of Amholia Greras. Home to the fae court and the queen of the forest.

#### Location

Enera Savaci sits at the absolute center of Amholia Greras, roughly 70 miles from the nearest elven settlement (Imyena Edhil) through trackless forest. No trails lead here. No maps mark the route. The elves do not visit uninvited, and no invitation has been extended in living memory.

#### What Little Is Known

The elves know Enera Savaci exists because the fae have told them so. They know a queen rules from there because she has been referenced in the few communications the fae have deigned to share. Beyond that, details are scarce.

The fae court's relationship with the elven confederation is old—older than the Three Kingdoms Treaty, older than the individual kingdoms themselves. The fae were here when the elves arrived. They permitted settlement in certain areas. They did not explain their reasons.

#### The Queen of the Forest

She has no name the elves are permitted to use. She rules the fae of both Amholia Greras and Iyaklomori Grera—possibly others beyond elven knowledge. Her authority is absolute within her domain.

The queen has never met directly with elven representatives. Communications come through intermediaries: lesser fae who speak on her behalf, messages delivered through strange means. What she wants, what her goals are, what her relationship is with the elves—these are questions the elves have learned to stop asking.

The arrangement works. The treaties hold. The elves don't pry.

#### For Adventurers

Reaching Enera Savaci would be an extraordinary feat. The forest itself resists uninvited approach—trails that seem to lead toward the center curve away. Directions become unreliable. Time passes strangely.

If you somehow reached it, you would be entirely at the mercy of the fae court. The queen's hospitality is not guaranteed. Her justice follows no logic outsiders understand. You might be honored guests. You might be entertainment. You might be examples.

No one has tried in centuries. The elves consider such an attempt to be either suicidally foolish or a very slow method of suicide.

#### Speculation

Some scholars theorize that the queen's domain extends beyond the physical forests—that she claims something deeper, something tied to the land itself rather than just the trees growing on it. This would explain why the fae tolerate the elves at all: they're not competing for the same resources.

Others believe the queen is waiting for something. The arrangement with the elves is temporary, on a timescale the short-lived don't perceive as temporary. Someday the patience will end.

These theories are not discussed openly. The fae may be listening.

### Eshbya Hills

Tags: hills, geography, ruins, contaminated

A region of low hills in the southern foothills of the Kelder Mountains, within Deo Esari's claimed territory. Once home to several titan-bone harvesting villages. Abandoned 200 years ago after the contamination spread.

#### Geography

The Eshbya Hills lie west of the main Kelder range, in the transitional zone between mountain and lowland. The terrain is rolling, forested in places, with numerous exposed rock formations where titan bones were once quarried.

#### The Contamination

The southern harvesting disaster struck the Eshbya Hills hardest. The villages of Novranas, Salenial, and Myrth all had to be evacuated when workers began showing symptoms: wasting sickness, skin discoloration, children born wrong.

The specific cause remains sealed in priesthood archives. What's known publicly is that certain titan remains in this region were contaminated—not with anything so simple as disease, but with something that spread through contact and persisted across generations.

#### Current State

The villages still stand. The priesthood maintains warning markers at every approach. The contamination may have faded after two centuries—or it may be waiting. No one has been willing to test it.

Occasionally, desperate treasure-hunters or scholars petition the priesthood for permission to explore the ruins. They are refused. The priesthood's position is that the abandoned lands remain closed until someone develops a reliable way to detect and neutralize the contamination. No such method exists.

#### Ruined Settlements

- **Novranas**: Largest of the three villages. Administrative center for the southern harvesting operations.
- **Salenial**: Mining village focused on a particularly rich titan deposit.
- **Myrth**: Processing settlement where raw bone was prepared for transport.

All three are intact, frozen in time. Personal belongings remain where they were left. The evacuation was orderly but permanent.

### Extolmni Furis

Tags: hills, forest, geography, rakite

Forested hills in the central part of Rakite, where the Ver Pes river cuts through rising terrain between the Ektolmni Grif and the plains proper. "Furis" means "hidden" in Rakiten—the woods here are dense enough to swallow sound and sight.

#### Character

Unlike the open hills of Ektolmni Grif, the Extolmni Furis are heavily wooded—oak, beech, and maple covering the slopes in a tangle of old growth. The terrain is less broken than the western hills, but the forest makes navigation difficult. Paths disappear. Landmarks vanish behind trees. Even experienced Rakiten hunters get turned around here.

The Ver Pes flows through a narrow valley that cuts the Furis in half. This gap is the only reliable route through the hills—the forest is too thick for cross-country travel. Tribes following the river between Tyror Miig and Tyror Weklis pass through the gap, but they don't linger.

#### The Hidden Groves

Scattered through the Extolmni Furis are clearings where the trees draw back, leaving circles of grass twenty to fifty feet across. The Rakiten call these *furis-keth*, "hidden stones," because each clearing contains a boulder or stone outcrop at its center.

The stones are unremarkable—grey granite, weathered and moss-covered, showing no signs of carving or deliberate placement. But the clearings around them are wrong. The grass grows too green. Mushrooms cluster at the forest edge. Animals avoid the spaces—no tracks, no droppings, no birdsong.

Rakiten tradition holds that the *furis-keth* mark places where something sleeps. What sleeps, no one says. The clearings are avoided, and children are warned not to touch the stones.

#### Hunting Grounds

Despite its strangeness, the Extolmni Furis provides excellent hunting. Deer are plentiful in the oak-mast season. Wild boar root through the forest floor. The rare forest buffalo—smaller and darker than their plains cousins—shelter here during harsh winters.

Hunting parties enter the Furis at dawn and leave before dusk. They follow the river valley, venturing into the deeper woods only when pursuing wounded game. They don't camp under the trees. They don't build fires. They take what they need and get out.

The Furis provides generously, and the Rakiten don't ask why. Some gifts are better not questioned.

### Illron

Tags: state, nation, elven, confederation, fae

The southernmost and most traditional of the three elven kingdoms. Most of Illron's nominal territory is Iyaklomori Grera—a vast forest that belongs to the fae under an ancient treaty. The elves live only on the edges.

For full political and cultural details, see the [Illron state entry](../../nations_and_powers/states/Illron.md).

#### Geography

Illron is bounded by the Ocean of Elorinia (west), Amholia Greras (north), Wycendeula (south), and the Kelder foothills (east). Most of the interior is fae territory that the elves may cross but not settle.

**Major Features:**

- **Iyaklomori Grera**: The great forest at Illron's heart. Fae territory. Three rivers run through it but no elven settlements exist within.
- **Poscuni Gretanu**: Grasslands on the northeastern edge, transitioning to Amholia Greras.
- **Kilren's Palace**: Ruined fortress in the forest's center. Contains the finest titan-bone armory ever assembled—untouched because anyone who enters doesn't return unchanged.

**Rivers:**

- **Kilgre Venora**: Northern river, one of two legal travel routes through fae territory
- **Ver Ta'Eres**: Central river, site of Kilren's Palace
- **Ver Suterela**: Southern river

#### Major Settlements

Illronese settlements are arranged on the forest's edges, never within:

- **Ishla'Anore**: Capital, eastern edge
- **E'lethelas**: Secondary city, south of capital
- **A'valenor**: Northern coast, on the Air astral current
- **Olymethemar**: Central coast
- **Hassera**: Southern tip

#### Character

Illron is defined by what it doesn't use. Most of the kingdom is forest the elves have agreed not to settle. They follow the old ways because they've seen what happens when they don't—Kilren's Palace stands as permanent reminder.

### Imyena Edhil

Tags: city, lenora, exile, sacred

The City of the Grieving. A port in southern Lenora, accessible only by river (Kilgre Thovrys) or sea. No roads connect it to the rest of the kingdom. This isolation is deliberate—Imyena Edhil exists to contain those who have committed an unforgivable sin.

#### The Grieving

In elven belief, every person's spirit persists in Celestia so long as their true name is remembered. When the last person who knows a name forgets it, that spirit is lost forever—the most permanent death possible, beyond any resurrection or communion.

If you are responsible for such a loss—through negligence, malice, or simple failure of memory—you have committed something unforgivable. You are **Grieving**. Your presence is spiritually contaminating. Prolonged contact with you might cause others to forget.

The Grieving are exiled to Imyena Edhil. They may never leave.

#### The City

Imyena Edhil is walled. The walls aren't to keep enemies out—they're to keep the Grieving in. Gates open to receive new exiles and to allow limited trade at the river docks. They do not open for residents to depart.

But Imyena Edhil is a city, not a prison:
- The Grieving have children, and those children inherit the stain
- The city has existed for millennia; thousands of elves live here now
- They've built their own society: fishing, river trade within limits, crafts, art
- They have festivals, families, schools, temples—all the trappings of civilization
- Ships can dock at the river mouth, but outsiders rarely enter the walls

The city is beautiful. The Grieving have had centuries to build. Their architecture is distinctive—there's a tradition of elaborate memorial structures, honoring names that might otherwise be lost.

But there's a weight to the place. Everyone knows why they're there. Everyone knows they'll never leave. Visitors describe Imyena Edhil as melancholy but not miserable—like a funeral that has lasted for generations and become its own form of life.

#### Escape and Pursuit

Anyone who flees Imyena Edhil is hunted. Not killed—returned. The other cities don't want the Grieving among them.

The pursuit is relentless. Escaped Grieving have been tracked across continents. The Lenorans view this as necessary spiritual quarantine, not cruelty. The Grieving themselves mostly accept their fate—they were raised to understand it, after all.

Occasionally someone tries anyway. They rarely get far.

#### Trade and Contact

Ships can approach the river docks, but most captains avoid Imyena Edhil if they can help it. The stigma extends to those who associate too closely with the Grieving.

Those who do trade here find the Grieving are excellent craftspeople—they have time, after all, and nothing else to do. Imyena Edhil produces some of Lenora's finest textiles, jewelry, and carved work. The items are sometimes considered unlucky outside the city, but they sell regardless.

#### For Adventurers

Imyena Edhil is not forbidden to visitors. You can dock, enter the walls, conduct business, and leave. The Grieving are polite hosts—they don't see many outsiders and tend to be curious about the world beyond their walls.

Just don't stay too long. Don't form attachments. And understand that if you help a Grieving escape, you'll make enemies of every elf who considers the contamination real.

Potential hooks:
- Someone important to the party is Grieving—can they be extracted?
- A Grieving elder holds information the party desperately needs
- An escaped Grieving has hired the party to protect them from pursuit
- The party is hired TO pursue an escaped Grieving—do they return them?

#### Questions Without Answers

Some younger Lenorans, far from Imyena Edhil, quietly question whether the contamination is real. Whether exile is just. Whether children should pay for their ancestors' sins.

These questions are dangerous to voice. The system has worked for millennia. The Grieving accept their fate. Challenging it challenges the entire elven understanding of names, spirits, and death.

But the questions persist anyway, in whispers, in academic texts that circulate privately, in the minds of elves who've met the Grieving and found them no different from anyone else.

### Inglingi Eror

Tags: hills, geography

Hills within Illron.

TODO

Sounds of children's laughter can be heard from the hills. Elven witches live there.

### Iyaklomori Grera

Tags: forest, fae, sacred, illron

The great forest at the heart of Illron. Unlike Elorshianod in Lenora, which is settled and worked, Iyaklomori Grera is empty of elven habitation. It belongs to the fae under a treaty older than the elven confederation itself.

#### Geography

Iyaklomori Grera fills most of Illron's nominal territory—hundreds of square miles of old-growth forest. Three rivers run through it: Kilgre Venora in the north, Ver Ta'Eres in the center, and Ver Suterela in the south. Any of these could support thriving settlements. None do.

The forest is bounded by the Ocean of Elorinia to the west, the Poscuni Gretanu grasslands to the east (transitioning to Amholia Greras), and coastal scrubland to the south near Hassera.

#### The Fae Treaty

The Illronese have a treaty with the fae court. The terms are simple:

1. Elves may travel on two designated routes: the river-road along Kilgre Venora (connecting Ishla'Anore to A'valenor), and the diagonal trail from Hassera to E'lethelas
2. Elves may not settle, build, or clear any part of the forest
3. Elves may not hunt, harvest, or take anything that grows within the bounds
4. In exchange, the fae leave the coastal settlements and eastern edge alone

The treaty predates the Three Kingdoms Treaty by at least a millennium. When the confederation was formed, Illron's representatives insisted that their prior obligations be acknowledged. Lenora and Deo Esari agreed—the forest wasn't theirs anyway.

#### Enforcement

Breaking the treaty's terms is not punished by elven law. The fae handle enforcement themselves.

Travelers on the legal routes report being watched constantly. Movement in peripheral vision. Laughter at night. The sensation of attention from all directions. Nothing directly hostile—but nothing welcoming either.

Those who stray from the paths, or who take something, or who linger too long, mostly are never seen again. The few who return are changed—silent, hollow, wrong in ways that are hard to articulate. They live out their remaining years but never speak of what happened.

The Illronese don't ask questions. They stay on the paths. They keep moving. They've learned.

#### The Diagonal Trail

The 180-mile trail from Hassera to E'lethelas crosses the forest's heart. It exists because sometimes people need to cross—emergencies, military necessity, official business that can't wait for the longer coastal route.

The journey takes 8-10 days. Most elves who've walked it once refuse to do it again. The watching is constant. Sleep comes hard. The forest feels wrong—not aggressive, exactly, but attentive. Hungry, maybe. Patient.

There are no inns, no rest stops, no designated campsites. Travelers bring everything they need and move as quickly as they can.

#### Kilren's Palace

At the forest's center, on the banks of the Ver Ta'Eres, stands the ruins of Kilren's Palace. Built 3,000 years ago by King Kilren in defiance of the treaty. Now a monument to what happens when elves forget their place.

See the Kilren's Palace entry for the full story. In brief: ten thousand soldiers vanished overnight. The king returned mute and hollow. The finest titan-bone armory ever assembled sits untouched in the fortress, and will remain so forever, because no one who enters comes back unchanged.

#### Why the Elves Accept This

Outsiders sometimes ask why Illron tolerates a treaty that gives most of their territory to the fae. The answer is simple: they tried the alternative.

Before the treaty, the elves attempted to settle Iyaklomori Grera. Every attempt failed. Not through direct violence—the fae don't fight wars in the conventional sense—but through attrition, madness, disappearance, and the slow erosion of will. Settlements that should have thrived withered. Populations declined. People forgot why they'd come.

Eventually, the elves negotiated. The treaty gave them the edges—the coast, the eastern margin. It gave them safe passage on designated routes. In exchange, they accepted that the forest would never be theirs.

It's not a good deal by any measure except one: it's better than the alternative.

### Kilren's Palace

Tags: fortress, ruins, poi, fae, treasure

A ruined fortress in the heart of Iyaklomori Grera, standing on the banks of the Ver Ta'Eres river. Built 3,000 years ago by King Kilren of Illron in defiance of the fae treaty. Now empty, preserved, and extremely dangerous to enter.

#### History

King Kilren was young, ambitious, and frustrated. His ancestors had accepted a treaty that gave most of Illron's territory to the fae. Kilren believed the stories were exaggerated, the fae overrated, the restrictions unnecessary. He decided to prove it.

He marched 10,000 soldiers into Iyaklomori Grera. He brought the royal armory—the finest weapons the elves had ever forged, many worked from titan bone and blood. He intended to establish a permanent military presence and demonstrate that elves could reclaim their own land.

The forest let them enter. Let them clear a site on the Ver Ta'Eres. Let them quarry stone from the riverbed. Let them build. Kilren's Palace rose over the course of a year: proper fortress walls, garrison quarters, armories, storage. Ten thousand elves settled in.

For one full year, nothing happened. Kilren began to believe he had won.

Then, one night, everyone inside vanished.

Not killed—gone. The fortress stood empty the next morning. Food sat uneaten on tables. Weapons hung in racks. Personal effects lay where they'd been left. Ten thousand elves had simply ceased to be present.

King Kilren was found a week later, walking out of the forest toward Ishla'Anore. He couldn't speak. He never spoke again—never wrote, never gestured meaningfully, never communicated in any way for the remaining forty years of his life. When he died, he was buried without ceremony. His name is not among those the Illronese remember.

#### The Armory

Kilren brought the finest weapons the elves possessed:

- **Titan-bone blades**: Swords, spears, axes forged from processed titan bone. Lighter than steel, harder than anything, and effectively eternal. Dozens of them.
- **Titan-blood armor**: Worked with blood from the titan remains, giving the metal a dark red sheen. Highly resistant to both physical and magical damage.
- **Siege equipment**: Ballistae with titan-sinew cables, rams with titan-bone heads.
- **The King's Own**: Kilren's matched set—a blade and bow of legendary craftsmanship, said to be the finest weapons ever produced by elven hands.

All of it is still there. Untouched. Undisturbed. Worth more than most kingdoms' treasuries.

The elves won't touch it. Taking anything from the palace would violate the treaty with the fae, and the lesson of what happens when you violate that treaty is standing right there.

#### What Happens to Those Who Enter

The few outsiders who learn about the treasure and attempt to claim it almost never return.

Those who do return are:
- **Like Kilren**: Mute, hollow, unable or unwilling to communicate. They live out their remaining years in silence.
- **Worse**: Changed in ways that are difficult to describe. Wrong. Something behind their eyes that wasn't there before.
- **Missing time**: They went in yesterday and emerged a decade later. Or the reverse—spent what felt like years inside and emerged the same day.

The fae don't seem to kill intruders. They do something else. No one's entirely sure what. The result is that the armory remains fully stocked despite being common knowledge among treasure-hunters and adventurers.

#### The Palace Today

Kilren's Palace still stands, preserved as if the centuries haven't passed. Vines don't grow on the walls. Animals don't nest in the rafters. The clearing around it never closes in.

The fortress sits in silent waiting. For what, the Illronese don't know. They don't want to know. They're content to let the palace remain exactly as it is, forever, as monument and warning.

#### For Adventurers

If you're determined to try:
- The palace is roughly 90 miles from the nearest settlement through fae-controlled forest
- The legal trails don't go anywhere near it
- The fae know when someone enters with intent to take
- No amount of magical protection has ever been sufficient
- Even if you retrieve something, where do you sell titan-bone weapons when the only people who can identify them are the elves who want you dead?

The smart play is to admire the legend from a distance and seek treasure elsewhere.

### Kirthdron Soytas

Tags: region, geography, ruins, contaminated

The southernmost of the abandoned harvesting regions in Deo Esari's territory. Contains the ruins of Sarki Tulo and sits at the transition between the Kelder range and the Mathavia Mountains.

#### Geography

Kirthdron Soytas marks where the Kelder Mountains give way to the Mathavia range. The terrain is steep and broken—good for finding exposed titan remains, difficult for sustained habitation. This was frontier territory even before the contamination.

#### The Contamination

Kirthdron Soytas was evacuated along with the other southern sites 200 years ago. The region may have been the last to show contamination symptoms, or it may simply have had a smaller population to evacuate. Either way, it's been closed ever since.

#### Current State

Warning markers surround the region. The priesthood has declared it permanently off-limits. No exceptions.

#### Sarki Tulo

The only significant settlement in Kirthdron Soytas. Sarki Tulo was a support village for harvesting operations in the deeper mountains. It sits abandoned now, like all the southern sites—intact, empty, waiting.

Some expedition proposals have focused on Sarki Tulo specifically, arguing that its position at the edge of the contaminated zone might make it safer to explore. The priesthood has rejected all such proposals. The contamination doesn't respect convenient boundaries.

### Kro Nymos

Tags: lake, geography, farlands

The lake at the heart of Xi'ivrach territory—a crescent-shaped body of water cradled in a mountain valley, its western shore rising into the Sunset Mountains, its eastern shore home to the city of Jeh Bli.

The name means "still eye" in the Xi'ivrach tongue, and the description fits. Kro Nymos is deep, cold, and unnervingly calm. Even when wind tears through the valley, the lake's surface barely ripples. The orcs have lived on its shores for centuries; they've never seen it freeze, never seen it flood, never seen it change level by more than a hand's width.

#### The Water

The lake is fed by snowmelt from the Sunset Mountains—a dozen streams cascading down the western slopes, pooling in Kro Nymos, with no visible outlet. The water should be rising. It isn't. The orcs assume it drains through underground channels, flowing toward the ocean through caves beneath the mountains.

The water is drinkable but tastes faintly of metal and something else—something the orcs describe as "the taste before lightning." Fish thrive in the lake: silver-scaled trout, bottom-dwelling catfish with whiskers like rope, and the armored *kro-zheth* that the orcs prize for their dense, oily flesh. The fishing is good. It's always been good. The lake provides.

At depth, the water turns black. Not dark—black. Divers report losing all sense of up and down, of seeing nothing, of feeling the water change temperature erratically. Most don't dive deep. The ones who've gone past fifty feet describe hearing sounds: clicks, tones, something that might be voices speaking a language made of echoes.

The orcs don't dive anymore. They fish from the surface and don't ask what lives below.

#### The Crescent Shore

The lake curves around a central ridge of submerged rock, creating two arms of water that reach toward the mountains. The city of Jeh Bli occupies the southern shore, built on a natural harbor where the water is shallow enough to wade.

The northern arm is avoided. The water there is deeper, colder, and the fish won't enter it. The northern shore is bare rock, polished smooth by something other than waves—great curved surfaces that look almost deliberate, almost carved. The orcs call it *Kro Gheth*, "the still side," and treat it as sacred ground. No hunting, no fishing, no building.

Once a year, on the longest night, the shamans paddle across to the northern shore and spend the night there alone. They don't discuss what happens. They come back quieter, more thoughtful, occasionally marked by pale scars that weren't there before.

#### The Island

A single island rises from the lake's center—a spire of volcanic rock about two hundred feet across, covered in dense vegetation that shouldn't survive at this altitude. The orcs call it *Ghural-Kro*, "the eye's pupil," and they don't land there.

From shore, the island looks unremarkable: trees, scrub, the occasional bird circling above. But boats that approach too closely find the water resisting them—not current, not wind, just a sense of pushing back that gets stronger the closer they get. Swimmers report the same thing, and worse: the feeling of something watching them from below, of vast attention turning their direction.

The shamans say *Ghural-Kro* is where the lake thinks. This is not meant as metaphor.

Whatever bargain the Xi'ivrach struck to live here, the island is part of it. They feed it—not with sacrifice, exactly, but with offerings: carved bone, worked metal, occasionally something alive. They row out as close as the water allows and throw their gifts toward the shore.

The offerings sink. They never wash up again.

### Kro Shiik

Tags: lake, geography, rakite

The central lake of Rakite—a long, shallow body of water fed by the Ver Pes river and drained toward the eastern coast. "Kro Shiik" means "gathering water" in Rakiten, and the name reflects its primary purpose: this is where the tribes meet.

#### Character

Kro Shiik is unremarkable by the standards of lakes. It's perhaps five miles long and a mile wide, oriented roughly east-west. The water is brown with sediment most of the year, clearing briefly in late winter before spring runoff muddies it again. The shores are marshy in places, firm in others, and lined with the only significant tree growth for miles—cottonwoods and willows that draw on the shallow water table.

The lake is shallow—rarely more than fifteen feet at its deepest—and warm enough for comfortable swimming in summer. Fish are plentiful but small, mostly carp and perch. Waterfowl nest in the marsh sections, providing eggs and meat for tribes camped nearby.

It's a practical place, not a sacred one. The Rakiten value Kro Shiik for what it provides: water, food, and a fixed point in a landscape that otherwise has none.

#### The Convocation

Once a year, at the autumn equinox, tribal leaders gather at Kro Shiik for the annual convocation—the only time all Rakiten tribes come together in one place. Camps ring the lake, arranged by tradition: each tribe has its customary location, and disputes over placement have been known to derail entire gatherings.

The convocation lasts five days. The first is for arriving and establishing camps. The second through fourth are for discussion, negotiation, and the resolution of inter-tribal disputes. The fifth is for leave-taking and the ceremonies that mark the end of gathering season.

Decisions at the convocation are made by consensus. In practice, this means most decisions aren't made—the tribes are too independent, too suspicious of each other, too committed to their own ways. But the gathering serves other purposes: marriages are arranged, trading conducted, news exchanged, and alliances quietly formed.

#### The Bone Shore

The southeastern shore of Kro Shiik is called the Bone Shore—a stretch of marshy ground where buffalo occasionally die during winter crossings. The carcasses accumulate over years, their bones eventually washing into shallow water or sinking into the mud.

The Rakiten consider the Bone Shore sacred. The spirits of the dead buffalo are believed to linger here, and their blessing is sought before major hunts. Offerings are left at the water's edge: tobacco, carved bone, occasionally drops of blood.

Some tribes believe that a white buffalo died here in the mythic past, and its spirit guards the lake. Others say the Bone Shore is simply where death gathers, and the spirits are hungry rather than benevolent. The practical result is the same: no one fishes or hunts near the southeastern shore, and camps avoid the area.

#### The Current Problem

The Roule colonial villages are visible from Kro Shiik on clear days—thin columns of smoke on the eastern horizon, marking where the halflings have burned the grass.

At last year's convocation, the smoke was a constant presence. The tribes debated what to do about it for three days and reached no conclusion. The isolationist faction argued for continued withdrawal. The militant faction argued for war. The largest faction—the one that couldn't agree on anything—argued for more discussion.

This year's convocation is approaching. The smoke will be closer. The debate will be louder. And eventually, someone will have to decide.

### Laeroth Esori

Tags: poi, sacred, confederation

The meeting ground of the elven confederation. Laeroth Esori sits within Amholia Greras, at a site where lines drawn from the centers of all three kingdoms would intersect. Trails from Jien Asari, Ishla'Anore, and Thillesari converge here—roughly equidistant from each capital, though Thillesari's mountain location makes its trail somewhat shorter.

#### The Site

Laeroth Esori is a clearing in the forest, perhaps half a mile across. At its center stand the original treaty stones—massive carved monoliths bearing the terms of the Three Kingdoms Treaty in Old Elvish. Surrounding structures have been added over the millennia: meeting halls, guest quarters, archives. All are built to elven standards of permanence.

The clearing is always temperate regardless of season. No biting insects. No dangerous animals. The forest stops at the clearing's edge as if held back by an invisible wall.

#### The Enchantments

Over 4,000 years, every major elven enchanter has added something to Laeroth Esori. The site is now layered with magic like geological strata. Some documented effects:

**Truth-Binding**: Deliberate lies cause physical discomfort—not painful enough to serve as a reliable lie detector, but enough that skilled negotiators notice when someone is dissembling.

**Memory Preservation**: Anything spoken within the clearing is recorded in the treaty stones. Touch certain monoliths and you can hear echoes of debates from centuries past. Agreements made here cannot be "misremembered."

**Violence Dampening**: Weapons feel heavier. Anger fades faster than it should. It's not impossible to fight—but it's difficult to start a fight, and harder still to maintain the will to continue.

**Weather Control**: Rain doesn't fall within the clearing. Wind dies at the edge. Meetings are never cancelled for storms.

**Pest Exclusion**: No vermin, no biting insects, no dangerous wildlife. The clearing is supernaturally clean.

The enchantments weren't centrally planned. Each generation added what seemed useful. Some effects probably conflict; others have been forgotten. The elves themselves don't know everything the site does.

#### One of the Safest Places in the World

The combination of effects makes Laeroth Esori one of the safest locations for negotiation anywhere. Violence is suppressed. Lies are uncomfortable. Promises are witnessed by the stones and can be played back to future generations.

The ancestors who signed the original treaty are, in a real sense, still watching. Breaking your word at Laeroth Esori means breaking it in front of them.

This is why confederation disputes, however heated, never escalate to war. The treaties were signed HERE. Everyone knows what the terms were. No one can pretend otherwise.

#### Confederation Meetings

Representatives gather at Laeroth Esori when major decisions must be made. Each kingdom sends four representatives—two men, two women—following ancient protocol. Meetings can last days or weeks depending on the matter at hand.

The one-kingdom-one-voice principle means all three must agree on any binding decision. This frustrates Lenora, which has the largest population and feels entitled to more influence. Illron and Deo Esari remind them that population wasn't the basis for the original agreement.

#### Getting There

The trails to Laeroth Esori are well-maintained but not public roads. Travel is by permission only—representatives carry tokens of authorization that the fae of Amholia Greras recognize. Unauthorized travelers on these trails may find them less safe than they appear.

### Lenora

Tags: state, nation, elven, confederation

The agricultural heartland of the elven confederation, occupying the fertile lowlands and coastal forests of the western Farlands. Largest of the three kingdoms by population (~400,000), governed by the Landsmeet—a council of landholders.

For full political and cultural details, see the [Lenora state entry](../../nations_and_powers/states/Lenora.md).

#### Geography

Lenora occupies the territory between the Ocean of Elorinia (west), the Kelder Mountains (east), and the Amholia Greras forest (south). The terrain is primarily forested lowland and fertile plains.

**Major Features:**

- **Elorshianod**: Coastal forest running north-south along the western shore. Unlike Illron's Iyaklomori Grera, Elorshianod is settled and worked—river towns dot the banks of the Kilgre Kevi and Kilgre Apnuk.
- **Starluck Hills**: Southern hill country separating Lenora from Amholia Greras. Named for phosphorescent fungi that bloom on autumn nights.
- **Vokas Pendl**: Northern mountain spur where the Kilgre Kevi originates.
- **Drakwald Forest**: Northern forest bordering the empty wilderness.

**Rivers:**

- **Kilgre Kevi**: Northern river, from Vokas Pendl through Elorshianod to coast
- **Kilgre Apnuk**: Central river with many tributaries, feeds the capital at Jien Asari
- **Kilgre Thovrys**: Southern river, feeding the isolated port of Imyena Edhil

#### Major Settlements

- **Jien Asari**: Capital, inland on the Kilgre Apnuk
- **Eilren Thalas**: Primary port, southwestern coast
- **Imyena Edhil**: The City of the Grieving, isolated port accessible only by river or sea
- **Galaena Ancalen, Imsegroth, Ufa Caelora**: Coastal settlements along Kilgre Kevi

#### Character

Lenora is the productive, populated heartland—dense settlement, cleared farmland, road networks. The kingdom feeds the entire confederation and resents not having proportional influence in its governance.

### Mathavia Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A north-south mountain range forming the boundary between the elven territories of the Farlands and the Giant Lands to the east. The Mathavia Mountains are old and weathered, their peaks lower than the Drystone range but still formidable barriers to travel. Dense forests cover the western slopes (within elven territory), while the eastern slopes descend into the scrublands bordering the Xeltri Plateau and Malo Kon Greikh.

#### Strategic Position

The Mathavia Mountains serve as a natural defensive barrier for the elven kingdoms. Few passes exist, and those that do are closely watched. The giants of Malo Kon Greikh have learned to avoid the mountain approaches—elven archers in forested mountain terrain are a nightmare even for creatures of giant size.

#### Choking Mines

Located at the southwest point of the Marthavia Mountains, at the precise intersection of void and air leylines, the Choking Mines are among the most dangerous mining operations in Shyona. The intersection of these leylines causes air to spontaneously appear and cease to exist—miners can be breathing normally one moment and instantly choking the next as the air vanishes from their lungs.

The unpredictable nature of the void-air interaction makes the mines extremely sketchy. Many elves have died here, their bodies found frozen in poses of sudden suffocation. Despite the extreme danger, the mines contain valuable magical minerals and crystals formed by the leyline convergence, drawing prospectors willing to risk their lives for wealth.

### Mosimor

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

A ruined processing settlement in Tomgryir Eror, within Deo Esari's territory. Abandoned 200 years ago after the contamination spread from nearby Ot'Pelyon.

#### History

Mosimor served a similar function to Myrth in Eshbya Hills—it processed raw titan bone extracted from the surrounding quarries. The village handled materials from Ot'Pelyon and other Tomgryir sites.

When contamination symptoms appeared in Ot'Pelyon, Mosimor was next. The processing specialists who'd been handling Ot'Pelyon's output began showing signs within weeks. The evacuation order came shortly after.

#### The Evacuation

Mosimor was evacuated along with Ot'Pelyon. The processing facilities were abandoned mid-operation. Materials from Ot'Pelyon—possibly the most contaminated in the entire southern region—sat in the workshops when everyone left.

#### Current State

Mosimor remains off-limits. Given its proximity to Ot'Pelyon and the likelihood that it was processing the original contaminated materials, the priesthood considers it extremely hazardous.

Observation teams don't approach. The village is surveyed from ridge lines at distance. No one has entered in two centuries.

#### The Processing Facilities

Mosimor's workshops may contain materials from the original Ot'Pelyon deposits—the same remains that started the contamination crisis. If anyone wanted to study the source of the disaster, this is where they'd find samples.

The priesthood has no interest in such studies. Their position is that understanding the contamination's exact nature serves no practical purpose. The southern sites are closed. They'll stay closed. Knowing more won't change that.

### Myrth

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

A ruined processing settlement in Eshbya Hills, within Deo Esari's territory. Abandoned 200 years ago during the southern contamination crisis.

#### History

Myrth was where raw titan bone became usable material. The village housed workshops, kilns, and storage facilities where bone was cleaned, treated, and prepared for transport to the main Kelder settlements.

Processing was delicate work. The priests who specialized in it spent their lives learning the proper techniques. When the contamination appeared, these specialists were among the first to show symptoms—they'd been handling concentrated materials from across the southern sites.

#### The Evacuation

Myrth was evacuated along with Novranas and Salenial. The processing equipment was left behind. Partially processed materials sat in the workshops, never completed.

The priests and workers were relocated to quarantine settlements. Their specialized knowledge died with them over the following decades.

#### Current State

Myrth remains off-limits. The processing equipment is still there—valuable in itself, representing techniques that took generations to develop. But it's all potentially contaminated, and the priesthood won't risk recovering it.

Some of the partially processed materials in the workshops may still be dangerous. Some may be perfectly safe. The priesthood's approach is to assume everything in Myrth is hazardous until proven otherwise.

#### Lost Knowledge

The contamination didn't just kill people. It killed expertise. The priests who knew how to process southern deposits, who understood the subtle differences between sites, who could identify dangerous material by sight—they're gone. Two centuries of accumulated knowledge, lost.

Modern Deo Esari works the northern Kelder sites using techniques that may be less refined than what the southern specialists developed. The priesthood acknowledges this. They consider it an acceptable cost.

### Novranas

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

The largest of the abandoned villages in Eshbya Hills. Once the administrative center for the southern harvesting operations. Evacuated 200 years ago when the contamination spread.

#### History

Novranas was the hub of southern titan-bone harvesting. While Salenial and Myrth focused on extraction and processing, Novranas handled logistics: coordinating shipments, housing visiting priests, maintaining records of what was found where.

When the contamination appeared, Novranas had the largest population of the three villages. It also had the most contact with materials from across the southern sites—workers passed through regularly, materials were stored here temporarily. If the contamination spread through contact, Novranas was perfectly positioned to receive it from everywhere.

#### The Evacuation

The evacuation was orderly. The priesthood gave everyone time to pack essential belongings. They were relocated to quarantine settlements in the high mountains.

Most of the evacuees died within a generation. The contamination had already taken hold. Novranas was left behind—buildings intact, streets empty, records still filed in the administrative halls.

#### Current State

Novranas stands frozen. Two centuries of weather have weathered the exteriors, but the buildings remain structurally sound. Inside, according to the few authorized observers who've looked from a distance, everything appears largely undisturbed.

The village is off-limits. Warning markers surround it. The priesthood's position is absolute: no entry, no exceptions, until the contamination can be reliably detected and neutralized.

#### What Remains

Administrative records. Personal effects. Equipment. Two hundred years of accumulated dust on everything the evacuees couldn't carry.

Some scholars argue that Novranas's records could be invaluable—they might explain exactly what was found where, which deposits proved dangerous, what patterns the priests noticed before the evacuation. The priesthood refuses all requests to retrieve them. The risk isn't worth it.

### Ot'Pelyon

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

A ruined mining village in Tomgryir Eror, within Deo Esari's territory. Possibly the origin point of the southern contamination.

#### History

Ot'Pelyon was a mining village in the eastern valley of Tomgryir Eror. It worked some of the oldest titan deposits in the southern region—remains that had been buried deeper and longer than most.

According to sealed priesthood records, Ot'Pelyon was the first settlement to report contamination symptoms. Workers began showing signs of wasting sickness before anyone in Eshbya Hills or Kirthdron Soytas. If the contamination had a single source, Ot'Pelyon's quarries are the most likely candidate.

#### The Evacuation

Ot'Pelyon was evacuated early in the crisis—possibly before anyone fully understood what was happening. The population was relocated to quarantine settlements. Most died quickly; their exposure had been severe.

#### Current State

The village stands in the Tomgryir valley, warning markers surrounding it at a considerable distance. The priesthood treats Ot'Pelyon as the most dangerous site in the contaminated zone.

No observation teams approach the village itself. Distant surveillance only. The assumption is that whatever started here might still be active.

#### The Question

No one knows exactly what the miners found at Ot'Pelyon. The deposits they were working were old—titans that had been dead since the earliest phase of the God War, perhaps. Something in those ancient remains was different. Wrong.

The priesthood has theories, locked in their archives. They don't share them. The official position is that it doesn't matter what caused the contamination—what matters is that the area remains closed until the danger can be proven gone.

Some suspect the priests know exactly what happened and are keeping it secret to prevent panic, or to protect knowledge that shouldn't be spread. Others believe they're as ignorant as everyone else and simply won't admit it.

### Palace of Flickering Lights

Tags: poi, sarakiel, rakite

A marble fortress at the northern edge of Tyror Miig, where the plains give way to the Ves Kanis headwaters. Home to a community of fallen Sarakiel who've been here for a thousand years, slowly forgetting what they used to be.

The Palace sits at the intersection of the Light and Void leylines—where Kunus and Nilus cross. The original Sarakiel didn't choose this location by accident.

#### The Structure

The Palace is unmistakably not of this world. White marble walls rise sixty feet from the grassland, polished smooth as glass and carved with geometric patterns that hurt to look at too long. The architecture makes no concessions to the local environment—no windows facing the prevailing winds, no consideration for rain or snow, no practical features at all. It was built by beings who expected to fly.

The walls glow. Faintly during the day, more noticeably at dusk and dawn, brilliantly on moonless nights. The light flickers—hence the name—in patterns that might be random or might be communication. The Rakiten don't know. They don't watch long enough to find out.

The leyline intersection produces stranger effects. Shadows inside the Palace fall in impossible directions—sometimes toward light sources, sometimes perpendicular to any visible illumination, occasionally not at all. Objects left in certain chambers lose their shadows permanently. Others acquire too many. The Sarakiel have mapped which rooms are safe and which require caution, though the geography shifts with the seasons.

Inside, the Palace is a maze of high-ceilinged chambers and narrow corridors, all marble, all glowing. There are no stairs—the original inhabitants didn't need them—but ladders and rope bridges have been added over the centuries. The current residents have adapted, but the architecture remains a reminder of what they've lost.

#### The Inhabitants

Approximately two hundred Sarakiel live in the Palace, the descendants of a squadron that fell a thousand years ago. They still have wings—vestigial things now, too weak to lift them but too much a part of their identity to remove. They still have the pale skin and luminous eyes of their celestial ancestors. They still practice the rituals of purification that Sarakiel believe will one day restore them to the stars.

But they've been on the ground a long time.

The original Sarakiel chose this location because it was empty and defensible—a place to rebuild in isolation. They forbade contact with mortals, considering it contamination. Over generations, "forbidden" became "discouraged" became "pointless"—they had nothing to say to the Rakiten, and the Rakiten had nothing to say to them.

Then some of the younger angels started leaving the Palace. Curiosity, boredom, desperation—the reasons varied. Most were killed by Rakiten hunters who didn't know what they'd found. A few were captured and never seen again. One came back with information about the outside world, and the elders declared it dangerous knowledge.

The prohibition became absolute. No one leaves. No one enters. The Palace is the world.

#### The Faith

The Sarakiel of the Palace practice a degraded form of celestial religion—rituals whose original meanings have been lost, purifications performed by rote, prayers to a heaven that stopped answering centuries ago.

They believe they're in exile. They believe obedience will restore them. They believe the flickering light of their walls is a sign that the stars haven't forgotten them.

They're probably wrong about all of it, but the faith holds the community together. Without it, they'd have to face what they've become: not fallen angels awaiting redemption, but mortals with useless wings living in a monument to their ancestors' hubris.

#### The Change

Something has shifted recently.

The angels have been seen at the windows, watching the plains. They've never done that before—or if they did, they were never noticed. Now, Rakiten scouts report pale faces in the upper chambers, tracking the herds, observing the tribal camps, staring east toward the Roule villages.

One angel—a young female with cropped wings—broke the prohibition and walked into the grassland two months ago. She spoke to a Rakiten hunting party in passable Elvish, asked strange questions about the halflings to the east, and returned to the Palace before sunset. The hunters reported the encounter to their tribal elders. The elders didn't know what to make of it.

The Palace is waking up. The angels are thinking about the outside world for the first time in centuries. Whether this is good or catastrophic depends on what they decide to do next.

#### What They Want

Unknown—even to them, probably. The younger Sarakiel want to leave, to explore, to find purpose beyond endless purification rituals. The elders want to maintain the prohibition because change is terrifying.

Some whisper about the Roule. The halflings are burning the plains, disrupting the land, drawing attention. If outsiders keep coming, the Palace's isolation ends whether they want it or not. Better to act now, while they still have choices.

Others whisper about the leylines. The intersection of Light and Void that powers their Palace—illumination and negation, presence and absence—represents something the Sarakiel once understood intuitively. They've lost that understanding, but the power remains. If they could reclaim their connection to Kunus, perhaps even harness the paradox of the intersection, they might become something more than fallen angels waiting for redemption that will never come.

And a few—the oldest, the most devout—whisper about return. Not to the stars, but to relevance. A thousand years of hiding has accomplished nothing. Maybe it's time to be angels again, even if they have to do it on foot.

### Rivers of Rakite

Tags: rivers, geography, rakite

Three major rivers drain the Rakiten plains, flowing generally eastward from the Vokas Enrisikna mountains to the Bejeweled Sea. In a land without permanent settlements, these waterways serve as the closest thing to roads—fixed paths through an otherwise featureless landscape.

#### Ver Kanis

The northern river, originating high in Vokas Enrisikna and flowing east through Tyror Miig before turning southeast toward Kro Shiik. "Kanis" means "cold" in Rakiten; the river runs icy year-round, fed by snowmelt that never fully warms.

The Ver Kanis marks the boundary between the open plains and the Ektolmni Grif hills. Its banks are the primary summer gathering sites for the northern tribes, and the Ver Kanis Ford is the traditional meeting place for inter-tribal trade.

The Palace of Flickering Lights stands near the river's headwaters, though the Sarakiel inside don't use the water—they have their own sources, presumably, and the Rakiten don't ask.

#### Ver Pes

The central river, rising in the foothills where Vokas Enrisikna meets Vokas Pendi and flowing east through the Extolmni Furis before feeding Kro Shiik. "Pes" means "brown" in Rakiten; the river carries heavy sediment from the forested hills, running murky most of the year.

The Ver Pes valley provides the only reliable route through the Extolmni Furis, and tribes migrating between summer and winter grounds follow its course. The river is wider and slower than Ver Kanis, fordable in many places during dry months but treacherous after heavy rain.

The Kro Shiik convocation grounds lie where the Ver Pes enters the central lake, and the river's condition each autumn is taken as an omen for the year ahead. High water means conflict; low water means hardship; normal water means the spirits are content.

#### Ver Neles

The eastern river, draining Kro Shiik and flowing southeast to the sea. "Neles" means "lazy" in Rakiten; the river meanders across the coastal plains, its course shifting year to year as floods cut new channels.

The Ver Neles passes through the territory now occupied by Roule colonists. The halfling village of Golyayla sits on its banks, using the river for irrigation and transport. Before the colonists came, this was marginal Rakiten territory—too far from the core grasslands to matter much.

Now it matters. The Roule are damming the Ver Neles to control flooding in their fields. The Rakiten downstream haven't noticed yet—they rarely venture this far east—but when they do, the dams will become another grievance.

#### River Traditions

The Rakiten don't own the rivers—land and water belong to no one—but they do observe traditions about their use.

**Drinking**: Anyone may drink from any river. Water is life; denying it is murder.

**Fishing**: The tribe currently camped closest to a stretch of river has priority for fishing. Others may fish with permission.

**Crossing**: Anyone may cross any river at any time. Blocking passage is an act of war.

**Fouling**: Deliberately fouling water—with waste, poison, or corpses—is the gravest crime a Rakiten can commit. The punishment is exile and the erasure of one's scars from tribal memory.

The Roule colonists, of course, know nothing of these traditions. Their dams block passage. Their farms foul water with runoff. Every day they break laws they've never heard of, and every day the Rakiten have to decide whether to explain or retaliate.

So far, they've done neither. That can't last.

### Salenial

Tags: village, ruins, contaminated

A ruined mining village in Eshbya Hills, within Deo Esari's territory. Abandoned 200 years ago during the southern contamination crisis.

#### History

Salenial was a mining village—focused on extraction rather than processing. It sat near a particularly rich titan deposit, one of the most productive in the southern region. Workers here handled raw bone daily, moving it from quarry sites to the processing facilities at Myrth.

The village prospered for generations. Then the contamination appeared.

#### The Evacuation

Salenial was evacuated along with Novranas and Myrth. The miners and their families were relocated to quarantine settlements. Most didn't survive long—their daily contact with the contaminated materials had exposed them heavily.

The village was left behind. The quarries were abandoned mid-operation. Equipment sits where it was dropped.

#### Current State

Salenial remains off-limits under the priesthood's quarantine orders. The rich titan deposits that made it valuable are still there, untouched for two centuries.

Occasionally, someone proposes that the Salenial deposits might be safe now—that the contamination was specific to certain remains, or that it's faded over time. The priesthood points out that no one has developed a way to test this theory safely. The deposits can wait. They're not going anywhere.

#### The Quarries

The actual extraction sites near Salenial are exposed pits and tunnels where titan bone was removed from the earth. Some of these may have been the source of the contamination. Others may be perfectly safe. Without a way to tell the difference, the priesthood treats all of them as equally hazardous.

### Sunset Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, wilderness

A coastal mountain range running the length of the western Farlands, separating the interior from the Ocean of Elorinia. The mountains catch the last light of day, burning orange and red against the darkening sky—hence the name, given by sailors who've never set foot on them.

No one lives here. No one has ever lived here.

#### Character

The Sunset Mountains are young and vicious—sharp peaks, unstable slopes, narrow valleys choked with scree. The rock is a dark volcanic basite shot through with veins of copper that have never been mined. Snowmelt feeds seasonal streams that carve new channels every spring, making the terrain unpredictable even to those who've crossed it before.

The western slopes drop directly into the sea in most places, offering no harbors, no beaches, just cliffs and crashing waves. The eastern slopes are gentler but still brutal—dense scrub gives way to rockslides gives way to the Butterfly Forest at the mountain's feet.

#### Why No One Settles

The mountains offer nothing worth the trouble of taking it. The copper is too diffuse to mine profitably. The soil is too thin to farm. The slopes are too steep to graze. There's no pass worth defending because there's nothing on the other side except the ocean.

The Jeh Bli orcs hunt in the foothills occasionally, but even they don't venture into the heights. Their shamans say the mountains are *keth-vorai*—"stone that remembers"—though what the stone remembers, they won't say.

#### What Lives There

The mountains are not empty, just uninhabited by anything that builds.

**Stonewings** nest in the high cliffs—large predatory birds with feathers the color of granite. They hunt by dropping from tremendous heights onto prey below, striking with enough force to shatter bone. A full-grown stonewing can carry off a goat; a mated pair working together can take down an elk.

**Ridgebacks** are the apex predators: massive six-legged reptiles that blend into the volcanic rock. They're ambush hunters, lying motionless for days until something edible passes within striking distance. The Jeh Bli consider ridgeback hide extremely valuable and ridgeback hunting extremely fatal.

Something larger moves through the deeper valleys—tracks too big to be ridgebacks, claw marks on cliff faces twenty feet up. The orcs call it *Ghural-thek*, "the thing that walks standing up," and they don't go looking for it.

#### Ruins

There are structures in the mountains—old ones, older than the elves claim to have been here. Square foundations of fitted stone, carved channels that might have been aqueducts, the occasional staircase leading nowhere. Whoever built them is long gone, and the mountains have been pulling them apart ever since.

The orcs say the ruins are unlucky. The stonewings nest in some of them. The ridgebacks lair in others. And *Ghural-thek* has been seen near the largest ruin, a roofless complex of interconnected chambers in the heart of the range.

No one has explored the complex and returned to describe it. This doesn't mean no one has explored it.

### Tomgryir Eror

Tags: region, geography, ruins, contaminated

A hilly region in the southern Kelder foothills, within Deo Esari's territory. Once productive titan-bone harvesting ground. Abandoned 200 years ago after the contamination spread through the southern sites.

#### Geography

Tomgryir Eror sits between the Eshbya Hills to the north and Kirthdron Soytas to the south. The terrain is rougher here—steeper slopes, deeper valleys, more exposed titan remains. This was considered prime harvesting territory before the disaster.

#### The Contamination

Like the other southern sites, Tomgryir Eror was evacuated when workers began showing symptoms. The villages of Ot'Pelyon and Mosimor were both abandoned within months of each other.

The contamination in Tomgryir Eror may have been the original source—some priestly records suggest the first cases appeared here before spreading to neighboring regions. If true, this area may be more dangerous than the others.

#### Current State

Warning markers surround the region. The priesthood has declared it permanently off-limits. Unlike some other abandoned sites, there's no serious debate about reclaiming Tomgryir Eror—the consensus is that whatever started here should stay buried.

#### Ruined Settlements

- **Ot'Pelyon**: Mining village in the eastern valley. First to report symptoms.
- **Mosimor**: Processing center. Evacuated after Ot'Pelyon's population began dying.

Both settlements remain intact. The priesthood occasionally sends observation teams to the region's edges to confirm the ruins haven't been disturbed.

### Troikan Strait

Tags: strait, water, geography

The channel separating the northern Farlands from the Seacliff Coast islands. Roughly fifteen miles wide at its narrowest point, with Ios visible as a dark forested line on clear days.

Nobody uses it.

The strait isn't dangerous—the currents are manageable, the weather predictable, the waters deep enough for any vessel. It simply doesn't go anywhere useful. Ios has nothing the Farlands want; the Farlands have nothing Ios needs. The elven kingdoms are five hundred miles south. Jeh Bli's orcs occasionally fish here, but they're not traders.

Sailors from Moigos or Iqes sometimes shelter in the strait during storms, using the Farlands coast as a windbreak. They don't land. There's nothing to land for.

#### The Nameless Capes

The Farlands side of the strait is a jagged coastline of unnamed headlands and shallow coves. The Sunset Mountains come down almost to the water in places, leaving narrow gravel beaches beneath sheer cliffs. A few sea caves pierce the rock, carved by centuries of waves. Local legend among the Jeh Bli orcs holds that something lives in the deepest caves—something that doesn't like light—but the orcs don't fish close to shore anyway.

The Ios side is gentler: the Koilos forest comes down to rocky beaches, with occasional streams cutting through to the sea. The trees are old and dense, and the shore is unwatched. Anyone could land there without being noticed, though why they would is another question.

#### What Passes Through

- Migratory fish in spring and autumn, following currents between the open ocean and the Middle Sea
- Storm-driven vessels seeking shelter
- Occasionally, something large moving beneath the surface—probably whales, probably

### Tyror Miig

Tags: plains, geography, rakite

The northern grasslands of Rakite—summer territory for the buffalo herds and the tribes that follow them. "Tyror Miig" means "high grass" in the Rakiten tongue, and the name is accurate: the grass here grows taller than anywhere else in the plains, sometimes reaching eight feet in good years.

#### Character

Tyror Miig is gentler than the southern plains. The land rolls in long, slow swells, and the rivers cut deeper valleys that provide shelter from the wind. The Ver Kanis flows down from Vokas Enrisikna, bringing snowmelt that keeps the grass green well into summer.

The buffalo come here in late spring, following the fresh growth northward. By midsummer, the herds number in the tens of thousands—a sea of dark backs moving through a sea of golden grass. The Rakiten tribes spread out across the plains during these months, hunting, trading, and gathering for the season ahead.

#### The Summer Camps

During summer, the tribes establish temporary camps along the river valleys. These aren't villages—nothing permanent is built—but the same sites are used year after year, and certain locations have acquired names and significance.

**Ver Kanis Ford**: The main crossing point on the northern river. Tribes gather here to trade and arrange marriages between groups that rarely meet otherwise.

**The Watching Rise**: A low hill that provides unusual visibility across the plains. Scouts use it to track herd movements. According to Rakiten tradition, this is where the first elves saw the first buffalo.

**Ektolmni Edge**: The transition zone where the plains meet the Ektolmni Grif hills. Hunting parties venture into the hills for deer and mountain goats, but they don't stay long—the terrain advantages belong to whatever lives up there.

#### The Palace's Shadow

The Palace of Flickering Lights stands at the northern edge of Tyror Miig, where the plains give way to the Ver Kanis headwaters. The Rakiten don't camp within sight of it. They don't hunt near it. They pretend it isn't there.

The angels inside pretend the same about them. It's worked for a thousand years.

#### Dangers

The grass conceals more than buffalo. **Tyror cats**—tawny predators the size of ponies—hunt the herds and occasionally take isolated elves. The tall grass makes them nearly invisible until they're already moving. Rakiten hunters learn to read the grass-patterns that indicate a cat's presence, but mistakes still happen.

During dry summers, fire is the greater threat. A single spark can ignite miles of grass in hours. The Rakiten have learned to use fire as a tool—controlled burns clear old growth and drive game—but uncontrolled fires have destroyed entire camps and scattered tribes for seasons.

### Tyror Weklis

Tags: plains, geography, rakite

The southern grasslands of Rakite—winter territory where the herds shelter from the cold winds that sweep down from the north. "Tyror Weklis" means "sleeping grass" in the Rakiten tongue, referring to the way the plains go dormant in winter, the tall stalks bending under frost and snow.

#### Character

Tyror Weklis is harder country than the north. The Vokas Pendi mountains block the southern horizon, and their foothills create broken terrain where the plains meet the rock. The grass grows shorter here—four to five feet in summer—and the soil is thinner, strewn with stones pushed up by ancient glaciers.

But the mountains also provide shelter. When winter storms howl across Tyror Miig, Tyror Weklis lies in a rain shadow. Snow falls lighter here, and the south-facing slopes catch enough sun to keep patches of grass accessible even in deep winter. The buffalo know this. So do the Rakiten.

#### The Winter Camps

The tribes converge in Tyror Weklis as autumn ends, gathering in the river valleys and mountain foothills. Winter camps are larger and more stable than summer camps—the same families return to the same sites each year, and the ground is marked by generations of fire pits and worn paths.

**Kro Shiik Shore**: The central lake where the annual convocation is held. During winter, tribes camp around its shores in an uneasy proximity, close enough to trade and negotiate but far enough to maintain independence.

**The Bone Fields**: A stretch of plains south of Kro Shiik littered with buffalo skeletons—the remains of generations of winter kills. The Rakiten consider it sacred ground. The bones are never disturbed; the spirits of the dead buffalo are believed to guide the living herds.

**Pendi's Foot**: The transition zone where the plains meet the Vokas Pendi foothills. Hunting parties range into the mountains for elk and bear, returning with meat and stories of what lives higher up.

#### The Drakwald Border

The southwestern edge of Tyror Weklis gives way to the Drakwald Forest, a dense woodland that the Rakiten avoid. The grass doesn't grow under those trees. The buffalo don't enter. The tribes have learned not to either.

Rakiten oral tradition speaks of a time when hunters chased game into the Drakwald and didn't return. Not killed—just gone, their trails ending at the treeline as if they'd walked into another world. The taboo against entering has held for generations.

#### The Roule Frontier

The eastern edge of Tyror Weklis includes the peninsula where Roule colonists have established their villages. This was always marginal territory—the grass thinner, the game sparser, the land less valuable than the central plains.

Now it's the front line.

The Rakiten can see the smoke from Roule cooking fires on clear winter days. They can smell the burning when the colonists clear new fields. Some of the younger warriors want to ride east and deal with the problem. The elders counsel patience—winter is no time for conflict, and the outsiders might leave on their own.

They've been counseling patience for twenty years.

### Ves Kanis

Tags: river, geography, rakite

The clearest water in Rakite flows from the Vokas Enrisikna mountains through the northern plains. "Ves Kanis" means "speaking water" in Rakiten—named for the sounds it makes tumbling over stones in its upper reaches, which the tribes say carries messages from the mountain spirits.

#### Source

The river originates in a cluster of spring-fed pools high in the Vokas Enrisikna. The Rakiten call these the Listening Pools—cold, clear water emerging from rock that supposedly "remembers" everything said near it. Hunters visiting the headwaters speak softly or not at all. Some claim the water repeats words spoken centuries ago, though no one admits to hearing anything specific.

The Light leyline passes directly through the source pools. On clear nights, the water takes on a faint luminescence—barely visible, but unmistakable to anyone who knows to look. The Rakiten avoid the headwaters after dark.

#### Course

Ves Kanis flows northeast from its mountain source, cutting through the edge of Vokas Enrisikna before emerging onto Tyror Miig. The river is narrow and fast in the mountains—dangerous to cross except at established fords—then widens and slows as it reaches the grassland.

The middle course provides the only reliable year-round water source in northern Rakite. Summer camps cluster along its banks at Ver Kanis Ford, where the river spreads shallow enough for horses to cross safely. The surrounding meadows are prime grazing, and hunting parties use the river as a landmark in the featureless grass.

#### The Palace

The Ves Kanis passes directly beneath the Palace of Flickering Lights, where the Light and Void leylines intersect. Here the river behaves strangely. Water flows slower near the Palace walls, as if reluctant to pass. Shadows fall in wrong directions—sometimes upstream, sometimes perpendicular to the sun. Fish avoid this stretch entirely.

The fallen Sarakiel who inhabit the Palace draw their water from the river but never bathe in it. They say the water near the intersection carries both illumination and erasure—that drinking too much shows truths better left hidden, while immersion risks losing memories entirely. Whether this is superstition or observed fact, the angels aren't saying.

#### Terminus

The river disperses into marshy ground north of Tyror Miig, eventually draining into the coastal waters. No settlements exist at its mouth—the land is too wet, the grass too thick, and the Rakiten have no use for permanent structures anyway.

#### Significance

Ves Kanis defines the northern limit of practical Rakiten territory. Beyond it lies the Palace (avoided), the coast (useless to horse nomads), and eventually the sea. The river itself is considered neutral ground—no tribe claims the water, and conflicts are suspended while drinking from its banks.

The Light leyline's presence makes the entire river corridor subtly wrong. Colors seem sharper near the water. Sounds carry further than they should. Dreams come more vividly to those who sleep on its banks. Most Rakiten treat this as unremarkable—just how the river is—but outsiders find it unsettling.

### Ves Neles

Tags: river, geography, rakite, roule

The contested river of eastern Rakite, flowing from Kro Shiik toward the sea through what is now Roule colonial territory. "Ves Neles" means "leaving water" in Rakiten—water that departs the homeland.

#### Source and Course

Ves Neles drains Kro Shiik from its eastern end, carrying the gathered waters of central Rakite toward the coast. The river begins wide and slow, meandering through Tyror Weklis—the southern grasslands that serve as winter territory for the buffalo herds.

The course runs roughly east-southeast, cutting through increasingly contested ground. Twenty years ago, this was empty prairie visited only by Rakiten hunting parties following the herds. Now the river passes within sight of halfling farms, its waters diverted into irrigation channels that feed foreign crops.

#### The Colonial Stretch

The lower Ves Neles flows through the heart of Roule's Rakite holdings. The three villages—Kilik, Ilyasca, and Golyayla—all draw water from the river or its tributaries.

**Kilik**, the oldest and largest settlement, sits at a natural ford where the river widens and shallows. The halflings built their first permanent structures here, and the village has grown into something approaching a proper town—wooden buildings, a central square, a small temple to Gythry. The ford is now a bridge.

**Ilyasca** lies downstream, where the river passes through low hills before reaching the coastal plain. The settlers chose this location for its defensible position; the hills provide warning of approach from any direction. Ilyasca is the most nervous of the three villages, its inhabitants convinced that something watches them from the grass.

**Golyayla**, the easternmost settlement, occupies the river's mouth where it meets the sea. A fishing village primarily, with boats that work the coastal waters and a small dock that receives supply ships from Roule proper. The colonists here spend more time looking seaward than inland.

#### The Problem

The Rakiten have noticed.

For years, the tribes treated the Roule settlements as a curiosity—strange little people who burned the grass and built pointless structures on good grazing land. The traditional response to problems is withdrawal: move the herds, find new territory, let the difficulty resolve itself.

But Ves Neles is different. The river connects Kro Shiik to the sea—the sacred gathering lake to the departing water. When Roule diverts the river, they interrupt a flow that has spiritual significance beyond practical water rights.

Young hunters have begun watching the settlements. Not attacking—the Rakiten gift-giving culture makes unprovoked violence shameful—but observing. Counting. Learning the halflings' routines. When the tribes finally decide to act, they'll know exactly where every colonist sleeps.

The Roule colonists, for their part, believe the land was empty when they arrived. They don't know the Rakiten exist. They don't know they're drinking contested water. They don't know that the occasional missing goat or unexplained fire isn't bad luck.

#### Significance

Ves Neles represents everything wrong with Roule's expansion: the casual assumption that unclaimed land is empty land, the failure to notice the people already using it, the incremental encroachment that feels like natural growth to the encroachers and deliberate theft to the displaced.

The river will eventually force a confrontation. Either the Rakiten will act, or the colonists will push far enough inland to discover Kro Shiik itself. Neither outcome ends well for anyone.

### Ves Pes

Tags: river, geography, rakite

The principal river of central Rakite, flowing from Vokas Pendl through the forested hills of Extolmni Furis to feed Kro Shiik, the sacred gathering lake. "Ves Pes" means "brown water" in Rakiten—an accurate description for most of the year.

#### Source

Ves Pes begins as snowmelt and spring seepage in the gentler slopes of Vokas Pendl. Unlike the dramatic mountain springs of Ves Kanis to the north, these headwaters emerge gradually—dozens of small streams collecting in high meadows before joining into a recognizable river.

The source region is prime summer hunting ground. Elk and deer congregate in the alpine meadows, and the clear upper streams hold trout worth catching. Tribes rotate through traditional camping sites, each family knowing which pools their grandparents fished.

#### The Forest Passage

The middle course of Ves Pes cuts through Extolmni Furis, the forested hills that give central Rakite its unsettled character. Here the river runs between dense oak and beech, its banks tangled with brush and deadfall. The water darkens as it picks up sediment and tannins from the forest floor.

Rakiten hunters follow the river through Extolmni Furis but don't linger. The *furis-keth*—those moss-covered stones in forest clearings where animals refuse to go—cluster near the riverbanks. Some say the stones drink from Ves Pes. Others say the river learned its brown color from them. Either way, the forest passage is for travel, not camping.

The Void leyline crosses Ves Pes somewhere in these hills. The exact location shifts, or the Rakiten who know won't say. Hunters report stretches where the water runs colder than it should, where fish float belly-up for no visible reason, where the reflection in the water shows a different sky than the one overhead.

#### Kro Shiik

The river empties into Kro Shiik from the southwest, spreading into a marshy delta before joining the lake proper. This junction is considered the boundary between wild country and civilized space—or as civilized as Rakite gets.

During the annual convocation, tribes camped near the river mouth have traditional rights to the freshest water. Disputes over these positions have shaped Rakiten politics for generations. Control of the Ves Pes delta doesn't confer military advantage—the Rakiten don't think that way—but it demonstrates that your ancestors earned something worth keeping.

#### Character

Ves Pes runs brown with sediment from spring through autumn, clearing only in winter when flow drops and the source pools freeze over. The water is drinkable but tastes of earth and leaf rot. Fish are plentiful in the lake-adjacent stretches—carp and perch that tolerate the murky conditions—but sparse in the forest passage.

The river floods unpredictably. Snowmelt years bring high water that reshapes the delta and drowns established camps. Dry years reduce Ves Pes to a series of connected pools. The Rakiten treat this variability as natural and plan accordingly; outsiders expecting reliable water levels are consistently disappointed.

### Vokas Enrisikna

Tags: mountains, geography, rakite, farlands

The western mountain barrier of Rakite—a rugged north-south range separating the plains from the Jeh Bli wilderness beyond. The name means "grey wall" in Rakiten, and the description is apt: the mountains present a uniform face of grey stone and sparse vegetation, discouraging passage in either direction.

#### Character

Vokas Enrisikna is not a dramatic range. The peaks are modest—rarely exceeding six thousand feet—and the slopes are more grinding than spectacular. But the mountains are wide, the valleys few, and the passes treacherous. There's no good route through.

The eastern slopes descend gradually into the Ektolmni Grif hills before giving way to the plains. This transition zone provides hunting grounds for Rakiten parties willing to venture into the broken terrain—deer, mountain goats, and the occasional bear.

The western slopes drop into the wilderness around Jeh Bli and the Butterfly Forest. No Rakiten goes there. The Xi'ivrach orcs occasionally appear on the mountain ridges, watching the plains, but they never descend into Rakite territory. The two peoples are aware of each other and mutually uninterested.

#### The Ver Kanis Source

The Ver Kanis river begins high in Vokas Enrisikna, fed by snowmelt and mountain springs. The headwaters are inaccessible for most of the year—steep terrain, unstable rock, and winter snow make the upper valleys impassable.

In late summer, Rakiten hunting parties sometimes venture into the lower canyons where the Ver Kanis descends. The fishing is excellent, and the valleys shelter game that's migrated up from the plains. But no one stays long. The mountains feel watched in ways the open plains don't.

#### What Lives There

The mountains host the usual alpine wildlife—elk, mountain goats, marmots, eagles. Nothing unusual, nothing dangerous beyond what you'd expect from wilderness terrain.

Except for the sounds.

Rakiten hunters in Vokas Enrisikna report hearing things at night. Voices echoing off canyon walls, speaking languages that don't sound like Orcish or Elvish or anything recognizable. Drumming that seems to come from inside the mountains. Occasionally, light glimpsed on distant peaks where no fire should be burning.

The orcs claim the mountains are *keth-vorai*—"stone that remembers." The Rakiten have their own word: *enris-weklis*, "grey sleep." Neither people investigates further. Some things are better left unknown.

### Vokas Pendi

Tags: mountains, geography, rakite

The southern mountain barrier of Rakite—a lower, wider range than Vokas Enrisikna, forming the boundary between the Rakiten plains and the territories beyond. "Pendi" means "horizon" in Rakiten; the mountains are always visible on the southern skyline, a constant landmark for the tribes.

#### Character

Vokas Pendi is gentler than the western range. The peaks are rounded by age, rarely exceeding four thousand feet, and the slopes are covered in scrub forest and alpine meadow. Several passable routes thread through the range, though the Rakiten rarely use them.

The northern foothills provide winter shelter for the buffalo herds and the tribes that follow them. The south-facing slopes catch sun even in deep winter, keeping patches of grass accessible when the plains are frozen.

#### The Southern Border

Beyond Vokas Pendi lies territory the Rakiten don't claim—the transitional zone between their plains and the elven kingdoms of Lenora and Illron to the south. The mountains serve as a natural boundary, and both sides respect it.

Lenoran traders occasionally cross Vokas Pendi to trade with the Rakiten, using the established passes in summer and autumn. These interactions are formal and carefully regulated—the Rakiten distrust outsiders, and the Lenorans consider the plains beneath their notice. But the trade happens: metal tools and salt flowing north, buffalo hides and grass-rope flowing south.

#### The Drakwald Connection

The western end of Vokas Pendi merges with the Drakwald Forest, creating a zone of mixed terrain—mountain slopes forested with the same too-dense, too-quiet woods that fill the Drakwald proper. The Rakiten avoid this area entirely.

Some tribal elders believe the Drakwald's wrongness originates in these mountains—that something lies at the heart of Vokas Pendi, spreading its influence into the surrounding land. Others say the forest and mountains merely share a boundary, and the wrongness ends at the treeline.

No one has checked which theory is correct.

## Sandreach

### Geography

Sand Reach is the massive desert that stretches across the entire northern portion of Upoceax, extending all the way to the northern coast. This is one giant barren desert—a scorching expanse of sand, rock, and relentless heat.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The desert extends to the northern coast—there is no land north of Sand Reach
- **East**: Transitions to Sequestria (barren plains) and the Free Isles offshore
- **South**: The Sand Reach Mountains form the southern boundary
- **West**: Reaches toward the Seacleft Coast and Greenwater Sea

#### The Two Deserts

Sand Reach is divided into two major desert regions:

- **Mendari Desert**: The western portion of Sand Reach
- **Luquihn Desert**: The eastern portion, extending to the Salt Flats at its northeastern tip

#### Major Features

##### Belu Jenari

A large volcanic mountain rising from the center of the desert—a dramatic landmark visible for miles across the barren landscape. Site where the legendary Demon Horn of Fire was forged.

##### Salt Flats

Located at the northeastern tip of Luquihn Desert, where the desert meets the coast.

#### Surrounding Waters and Regions

- **Greenwater Sea**: To the west, containing the island of Urok
- **Roule Channel**: The strait separating Roule from the mainland
- **Roule**: A halfling state north of Urok and north of Sand Reach
- **Lightning Passage**: Treacherous strait between the Sunshine Coast and the Free Isles, prone to violent electrical storms
- **Free Isles**: Island cluster to the east
- **Sequestria (Siquestrya)**: Barren plains to the southeast, between Sand Reach and the coast

#### Eastern Coastline

The eastern edge of the Sandreach and Siquestrya regions meets the sea along several distinct coastal zones:

##### Sunshine Coast

The northeastern coastal stretch where the Luquihn Desert meets the sea. Named for the relentless, unbroken sunlight that bakes this shore—there is little cloud cover this far into the desert's rain shadow. The coast is rocky and inhospitable, with few natural harbors. Small communities of salt-harvesters and fishermen eke out an existence here, trading with passing ships from the Free Isles.

##### Geyser Bay

A bay on the eastern coast where Siquestrya meets the sea. The bay takes its name from the thermal vents that dot the coastline and shallow waters, sending plumes of steam and mineral-rich water into the air at irregular intervals. The geysers make navigation treacherous for larger vessels, but the warm waters attract unusual marine life and the mineral deposits have modest value to alchemists. The centaur tribes of Siquestrya generally avoid this coastline, considering the geysers ill-omened.

##### Sandwurm Coast

The southeastern coastal region south of Geyser Bay. This desolate stretch earned its name from the massive burrowing wurms that hunt in the transitional zone where sandy soil meets the sea. The wurms are drawn to vibrations—ships anchoring too close to shore or travelers moving across the beach risk attracting these predators. The few who must travel this coast do so at low tide, moving quickly across wet-packed sand that muffles footfalls.

### Notable Regions

#### Sequestria (Siquestrya)

South of the Sandreach Desert and east of the Sandreach Mountains lies Sequestria—a plain savannah wasteland south and west of the Free Isles. North and west of this region rise the Lyagnadarr Mountains, home to Svorinthak the dragon.

Sequestria is home to warring centaur tribes engaged in constant posturing and attempts to assert dominance over each other. Each tribe is ruled by a chieftain who can be challenged by anyone willing to fight for the position. Combat follows mercy rules, and armor is rare—hard to make, slows you down, and inaccessible to most. Most warriors wield spears, bows, and scimitars.

The centaur tribes generally capture and sometimes kill visitors. They don't want anyone interfering with their way of life or their tribal conflicts.

###### Hermelia's Lair

Rising from the ruins of Shtaneres stands Hermelia's Lair—not a traditional dungeon but a tall sequence of connected spires reaching into the desert sky. This was the crypt and final home of Hermelia, a powerful mage who mastered both fire and air magic, granting her the ability to fly and rain down devastating fireballs on her enemies.

The spires are now inhabited by rocs—massive predatory birds that nest among the heights. At the core of the tallest spire runs a "spine" of concentrated fire magic, a pillar of flame that extends from base to peak. This spine stabilizes the entire structure, but it is also catastrophically dangerous—if the fire spine is broken or disrupted, the accumulated magical energy will detonate in a colossal explosion capable of leveling everything for miles around.

Treasure hunters brave enough to enter must contend with territorial rocs, navigate crumbling architecture hundreds of feet above the desert floor, and avoid damaging the fire spine at all costs.

### Bazaar of Scales

Tags: poi, settlement, trade

A sprawling desert market in the southern Luquihn Desert, positioned at the edge of the Lyagnadarr Mountains. The Bazaar of Scales is one of the few places where surface-dwellers can reliably trade with the Murazi—the underground merfolk who dwell beneath the desert.

The bazaar takes its name from its primary trade goods: scales, hides, and bones from desert creatures, along with the iridescent scales the Murazi harvest from subterranean fish. The market operates in a shallow canyon where ancient wells tap into underground water sources—likely Murazi engineering, though they neither confirm nor deny it.

Trade here follows its own rules. The Murazi emerge at dawn and dusk when temperatures are tolerable, conducting business through intermediaries who have learned their trade-sign language. Violence in the bazaar is met with swift collective punishment—the Murazi simply seal the wells, and without water, the surface market dies. This threat keeps even the most unscrupulous merchants civil.

The bazaar also serves as a waypoint for travelers heading to or from the Lyagnadarr Mountains, and a place to hire guides who know the deep desert routes.

### Belu Jenari

Tags: poi, volcano

A massive volcanic mountain rising from the center of the Sandreach desert—a dramatic landmark visible for miles across the barren landscape. This volcano was the site where the legendary Demon Horn of Fire was forged, drawing on the convergence of fire and light leylines beneath the mountain.

#### Temple of Bryn

Located in the foothills north of Belu Jenari, at the intersection of the fire and light leylines, the Temple of Bryn was once a magnificent structure dedicated to Bryn, the sun-god. The temple featured extremely bright eternal flames and a brilliant artificial sun at its center, channeling the raw elemental power of the leyline convergence.

The temple was destroyed during the formation of Belu Jenari itself—the volcanic eruption that created the mountain also devastated the temple, leaving only ruins. However, one artifact survived the cataclysm.

##### The Dawnbringer Stone

Within the ruins of the Temple of Bryn lies the Dawnbringer Stone, a sacred pedestal that holds Dawnbringer—a legendary sword forged from fire and light. The blade still rests in the stone, waiting for a worthy wielder who can withstand the searing heat and blinding radiance of the temple's remains.

### Dunes of Kalamesh

Tags: desert, geography

A vast expanse of towering sand dunes in the northeastern Luquihn Desert, stretching inland from the Sunshine Coast. The dunes here reach heights of several hundred feet—massive, shifting mountains of pale gold sand that reshape themselves with every windstorm.

The Kalamesh dunes are notoriously difficult to navigate. Landmarks disappear overnight as the sands shift, and the dunes create disorienting echo effects that confuse travelers. Local guides use the stars and the position of distant mountain peaks to navigate, but even experienced desert-dwellers treat the Kalamesh with caution.

Beneath the deepest dunes, rumors persist of buried ruins—remnants of a civilization that existed before the desert expanded to its current boundaries. Whether these ruins connect to the underground Murazi settlements is unknown; the Murazi themselves are secretive about what lies beneath the sands.

### Dustforge

Tags: citystate, settlement

A city-state in the southeastern Luquihn Desert, built around Esedin Lake—a large oasis fed by underground aquifers. Dustforge is one of the few permanent settlements in the Sandreach, made possible by reliable water access and ingenious architectural adaptation to the brutal desert environment.

#### Geography

Dustforge sits at the edge of Esedin Lake, where the flat desert gives way to rocky outcroppings that provide natural wind barriers. The city is largely underground, with most structures carved into the bedrock or built as reinforced bunkers. Only essential surface structures—watchtowers, trade pavilions, and the famous forges—brave the windstorms that scour the Luquihn Desert.

The city's position places it roughly equidistant from Belu Jenari to the northwest and the Lyagnadarr Mountains to the south, making it a natural waypoint for travelers crossing the desert.

#### Economy

##### Mushroom Trade

The underground caverns of Dustforge host extensive mushroom farms, fed by the moisture seeping from Esedin Lake. These fungi are cultivated in carefully controlled conditions and are prized across Alaria for their unique flavors and medicinal properties. Some varieties are mildly psychoactive; others have genuine healing properties. The mushroom trade forms the backbone of Dustforge's economy.

##### Dustforged Weapons

The city's namesake comes from its legendary smiths, who have perfected the art of sintering—a technique for working metals with extremely high melting points. Dustforged weapons are made from tungsten alloys that hold an edge longer than steel and resist breaking under stress. The process requires specialized furnaces that burn hotter than conventional forges, fueled by oils extracted from certain desert creatures.

Dustforged blades are expensive and rare outside the city. The smiths guard their techniques jealously, and the raw materials are difficult to source.

#### Esedin Lake

The oasis that makes Dustforge possible. Esedin Lake is roughly two miles across at its widest point, fed by aquifers that tap into deep underground water sources. The lake's shores are the only place for hundreds of miles where vegetation grows naturally—date palms, hardy scrub, and the distinctive blue-green algae that the mushroom farms use as a nutrient base.

The lake is considered sacred by the city's inhabitants. Contaminating its waters is a capital offense.

### Lightning Passage

Tags: strait, geography

A treacherous strait separating the Sunshine Coast from the Free Isles to the northeast. The passage takes its name from the violent electrical storms that sweep through with alarming frequency—sailors attribute this to the convergence of hot desert air from the Sandreach with cooler maritime winds from the open sea.

The strait is navigable but dangerous. Experienced captains time their crossings carefully, watching for the telltale cloud formations that precede the lightning storms. Ships caught mid-passage during a storm face not only the lightning itself but the choppy, unpredictable waves the storms generate.

Despite the danger, Lightning Passage sees regular traffic—it's the most direct route between the Free Isles and the Sunshine Coast's salt-harvesting settlements. Some merchants consider the crossing a worthwhile gamble; others prefer the longer but calmer route around the northern tip of the Free Isles.

### Mendari Desert

Tags: desert, geography

The western portion of the Sandreach, separated from the Luquihn Desert to the east by Belu Jenari and the surrounding volcanic badlands. The Mendari is generally considered the more hostile of the two great Sandreach deserts—less water, fewer landmarks, and longer stretches of featureless dunes.

#### Terrain

The Mendari transitions from rocky scrubland near the Hills of Gezzeri in the south to vast sand seas in the north. The central region is characterized by ergs—massive dune fields where individual dunes can reach heights of three hundred feet. These dunes migrate slowly westward, driven by prevailing winds off the Luquihn.

Unlike the Luquihn Desert, which has scattered oases and the settled presence of Dustforge, the Mendari has no permanent settlements. Water sources are rare and often seasonal—travelers must carry everything they need or know the location of hidden cisterns maintained by desert nomads.

#### The Volcanic Boundary

The badlands around Belu Jenari form the eastern edge of the Mendari. This transitional zone is a maze of lava fields, obsidian outcroppings, and thermal vents. The ground is treacherous—thin crusts of cooite rock can collapse into hidden voids, and pockets of volcanic gas accumulate in low areas. Few travelers cross directly through the badlands; most skirt north or south around the volcano's flanks.

#### Inhabitants

The Mendari is home to scattered bands of desert nomads who move between seasonal water sources and trade with the settlements at the desert's edges. These groups are insular and suspicious of outsiders but will sometimes guide travelers in exchange for goods they cannot produce themselves—metal tools, medicine, and news from the wider world.

The Gezzerin of the Hills of Gezzeri sometimes venture into the southern Mendari, but they rarely travel far from their cliff dwellings. The deep desert belongs to those who know its rhythms.

### Salt Flats

Tags: desert, geography, region

The Salt Flats mark where the Luquihn Desert meets the Gindrik Sea—a blinding white expanse of crystallized salt stretching roughly a hundred miles along the coast. What was once a shallow inland sea dried up over millennia, leaving behind salt deposits dozens of feet thick in places. The terrain is brutally flat, offering no shade and reflecting the sun with punishing intensity.

#### Geography

The Flats occupy the northeastern corner of the Luquihn Desert, bounded by:
- **North**: The Gindrik Sea coastline
- **East**: Open water toward the Strymün Isles and Gindrik Sea
- **South**: The Bone Hills, rising from the salt like the spine of some buried leviathan
- **West**: The endless dunes of the Luquihn Desert proper

The salt crust varies in thickness and stability. Near the coast, it's firm enough to support wagons and even small structures. Further inland, treacherous thin patches conceal brine pools that can swallow the unwary. Seasonal flooding during winter storms deposits new salt layers and reshapes the terrain annually.

Water is the Flats' most precious commodity. The few permanent springs are jealously guarded, and most inhabitants rely on distillation or imported water. The salt itself contaminates everything—metal corrodes within days, leather cracks, wounds heal slowly if at all.

#### Climate

Summers are lethal. Temperatures exceed what unprotected flesh can survive, and the reflected glare causes snow-blindness even with eye protection. The Kuzagt work their slaves primarily at night during these months, with daytime reserved for rest in underground shelters.

Winters bring relief and danger in equal measure. Storm surges from the Gindrik Sea can flood miles of the Flats within hours, dissolving the salt crust and creating temporary lagoons. These floods deposit fish, seaweed, and driftwood—harvested quickly before the water evaporates back to salt.

#### Resources

Salt is the obvious export, but not all salt is equal. The Kuzagt have identified dozens of distinct varieties based on mineral content, crystal structure, and depth of excavation. Some preserve meat better. Some enhance magical rituals. Some are poisonous to specific creatures. This specialized knowledge represents centuries of accumulated expertise that outsiders cannot easily replicate.

The Bone Hills provide a different resource entirely—ancient fossils and occasional mineral deposits. See below.

### Bonnetaz

Tags: city, state, nation

Bonnetaz rises from the Salt Flats like a fever dream—towers of white salt-brick and bone, their surfaces carved with geometric patterns that catch the light. From a distance, the city appears beautiful. Up close, visitors notice that much of the "bone" ornamentation is human.

The Kuzagt have ruled here for over a thousand years, since before humans arrived in significant numbers on this continent. Their city predates the slave camps, but the camps have made it wealthy beyond measure.

#### The City

Bonnetaz is built partially above ground and partially below. The surface city contains the administrative towers, trading halls, and residences of the ruling elite. The undercity—far more extensive—houses salt-processing facilities, cisterns, storage vaults, and the entrances to the slave tunnels that radiate outward beneath the Flats.

Architecture here follows Kuzagt aesthetics: angular, asymmetrical, with sharp edges and narrow windows. Buildings are constructed from salt-brick reinforced with bone (animal and human alike) and sealed with a resinous lacquer that prevents moisture damage. The older structures have developed a yellowish patina; the newest gleam white.

The city lacks walls. The Kuzagt consider fortification unnecessary—the Flats themselves are defense enough. Any army crossing the salt would lose more soldiers to exposure than combat.

#### Population

Approximately twelve thousand Kuzagt dwell in Bonnetaz proper, organized into an oligarchical council of thirteen. Each council seat is hereditary within certain bloodlines, with internal succession determined by assassination, ritual combat, or occasionally democratic vote depending on the family's traditions.

Rank is displayed through skull ornamentation. Common Kuzagt leave their distinctive cheekbone protrusions unadorned. Minor nobility embed small gems—garnets, amber, jade. Council members and their immediate families wear diamonds, sapphires, or rubies, sometimes multiple stones arranged in patterns that denote specific lineages.

The human population within the city proper is difficult to count. Perhaps three thousand work as domestic servants, skilled laborers, or specialized craftspeople—those whose talents make them too valuable for the camps. Their status falls somewhere between slave and citizen, permitted certain freedoms but never permitted to leave.

#### The Camps

Outside the city, the slave camps stretch across the Flats in a network of underground warrens connected by tunnels. Conservative estimates place the enslaved population at forty thousand, though the Kuzagt don't share precise figures. The camps serve multiple purposes:

**Salt Extraction**: The primary industry. Slaves excavate salt deposits, process them into various grades, and package them for export. Work shifts follow the seasons—surface work at night during summer, daytime during winter.

**Infrastructure Maintenance**: The tunnel network requires constant expansion and repair. Cave-ins are common. Workers who survive a collapse are considered lucky, not injured.

**Specialized Production**: Some camps focus on specific products—particular salt grades, bone processing, or the creation of goods from human materials. Kuzagt leather workers are renowned for their craftsmanship. They do not advertise their primary material.

Escape from the camps is theoretically possible but practically suicidal. The Flats offer no shelter, no water, and no direction. Those who flee typically die within days. The Kuzagt recover what remains and put the bones to use.

#### Trade and the Ivory Hand

Bonnetaz does not participate directly in slave acquisition—the Kuzagt consider such work beneath them. Instead, they purchase slaves through intermediaries, primarily the Ivory Hand merchant network. This organization maintains permanent representatives in the city, handling the logistics of human trafficking while the Kuzagt focus on "productive employment."

The Ivory Hand connection extends beyond mere commerce. Several Bonnetaz merchants hold membership in the organization, participating in its darker activities—including the supply of sacrificial subjects for Deoric rituals. The Kuzagt officially disapprove of Deoric magic but accept payment for "specialized inventory" without asking questions.

Other exports include processed salt (various grades), bone crafts, and certain alchemical compounds produced from the Flats' unique mineral deposits. Imports focus on food, water, metal goods, and luxury items for the elite.

#### Governance

The Council of Thirteen meets in the Pale Spire, the tallest structure in Bonnetaz. Sessions are closed to non-Kuzagt, and decisions are announced rather than debated publicly. The council handles external relations, major resource allocation, and disputes between bloodlines.

Day-to-day administration falls to appointed overseers, each responsible for specific aspects of city function: salt production, camp management, trade, water distribution, and so forth. These positions are held by Kuzagt of middling status, ambitious enough to work hard but not powerful enough to threaten the council.

The council's current composition has remained stable for nearly a century—unusual by historical standards. Some attribute this to the current prosperity; others whisper that the eldest members have found ways to extend their already considerable lifespans.

#### Relations with Neighbors

**Ethadia**: The nearest significant power. Ethadian merchants trade with Bonnetaz, carrying salt and bone-goods to markets across the Gindrik Sea. This relationship is profitable for both parties and maintained through careful diplomatic neutrality. The Ethadians know what happens in the camps. They do not discuss it.

**Gorath**: The Kuzagt view Gorath's slave trade with contempt—clumsy, brutal, and wasteful. They consider their own practices more refined, their treatment of slaves more "efficient." Gorath considers Bonnetaz too distant and too entrenched to conquer profitably. The two powers ignore each other.

**The Free Isles**: Occasional trading partners, though the Isles' populations include many escaped slaves. Bonnetaz merchants visiting the Isles do not discuss their city's economy.

#### What Outsiders Experience

Visitors to Bonnetaz are rare and carefully managed. Those with legitimate trade purposes are housed in designated quarters near the harbor, permitted access to trading halls and select entertainment venues, and prohibited from approaching the camps or residential districts.

The Kuzagt present a face of sophisticated commerce. Transactions are conducted with formal courtesy. Contracts are honored precisely. Violence is reserved for those who violate the rules.

Most visitors leave with valuable goods and a vague sense of unease they cannot articulate. The city is too clean, too quiet, too orderly. The Kuzagt smile with their thin lips while their dark eyes assess each guest's potential value.

Some visitors never leave at all. The Kuzagt do not discuss these disappearances.

---

### Bone Hills

Tags: hills, geography

The Bone Hills rise from the southern edge of the Salt Flats—a low range of weathered ridges that mark the transition from salt pan to true desert. The name predates Kuzagt settlement, though the elves have certainly contributed to its appropriateness.

#### Geology

The Hills are composed primarily of limestone and chalk, the compressed remains of ancient sea life from when this region lay beneath an inland ocean. Erosion has carved the soft stone into strange formations—pillars, arches, and honeycomb patterns that from a distance resemble skeletal architecture.

More significantly, the Hills contain genuine fossils. The ancient sea teemed with massive creatures, and their bones remain embedded in the rock. Some specimens are merely large. Others suggest beasts of sizes that strain credibility—skulls the size of houses, vertebrae requiring teams of slaves to excavate.

The Kuzagt harvest these fossils for construction material, decorative use, and occasionally religious purposes. Their bone-working traditions incorporate ancient remains alongside more recent acquisitions.

#### Mineral Deposits

Beyond fossils, the Hills contain useful mineral deposits: sulfur springs (valuable for alchemy), copper veins (largely exhausted), and occasional pockets of salt with unusual properties. Mining operations dot the hillsides, worked by slaves under Kuzagt supervision.

The most significant deposit is the Weeping Vein—a formation that produces a thick, oily substance with preservative properties. Applied to organic material, it prevents decay indefinitely. The Kuzagt use it on their most valued slaves, extending useful service lives by decades.

#### The Ossuary Roads

Ancient paths wind through the Hills, marked by standing stones and the occasional monument. These predate the Kuzagt, belonging to an unknown culture that left no written records. The monuments feature carved bones—or bone-shaped carvings—arranged in patterns that may be decorative or may be linguistic.

The Kuzagt have studied these sites without reaching conclusions. They maintain the paths for practical transportation purposes while leaving the monuments undisturbed. Some council members privately believe the original builders were ancestors of the Kuzagt themselves, though they cannot prove this theory.

#### Hazards

The Hills are not safe. Sinkholes open without warning where underground chambers collapse. Sulfur vents release toxic gases. And the fossils are not always entirely dead.

Certain excavations have uncovered remains that resist extraction—bones that move when unobserved, that appear in different positions from one day to the next, that occasionally disappear entirely only to resurface miles away. The Kuzagt have learned which sites to avoid. They do not share this knowledge with outsiders.

### Castle Alexandr

Tags: poi, fortress, ruins

Castle Alexandr stands on a promontory overlooking the channel between Bonnetaz and the Strymün Isles—a fortress of dark stone utterly unlike the salt-and-bone architecture of its Kuzagt neighbors. The castle predates Kuzagt settlement by centuries, possibly millennia.

#### History

No records survive to explain who built Castle Alexandr or why. The architecture suggests human construction—the proportions are wrong for elves—but no human civilization in the region's known history possessed the engineering skill evident in its construction. The walls are fitted stone blocks, each weighing tons, joined without mortar in a technique that modern builders cannot replicate.

The name itself is a mystery. "Alexandr" appears in no Kuzagt genealogy, no Ethadian chronicle, no surviving document from any regional power. The castle simply is, and has been, for as long as anyone can remember.

The Kuzagt occupied the castle briefly after establishing Bonnetaz, intending to use it as a watchtower and naval base. They abandoned it within a decade. The official explanation cites "strategic considerations." The unofficial explanation—shared only among council members—involves incidents the Kuzagt refuse to describe.

#### Current State

The castle stands empty but not ruined. Its walls remain intact, its towers upright, its gates functional. This is peculiar. Abandoned structures in the salt environment should corrode and crumble. Castle Alexandr does not.

Visitors report that the interior is spotlessly clean—no dust, no debris, no signs of animal habitation. Furniture remains in place, preserved as if the occupants stepped out moments ago. Food left in the kitchens does not rot. Water in the cisterns remains fresh.

The castle does not welcome extended stays. Those who attempt to sleep within its walls experience dreams of drowning, of darkness, of something vast and patient waiting beneath the sea. Most leave by morning. Some leave immediately. A few do not leave at all.

#### Strategic Position

Despite its unsettling nature, Castle Alexandr's position makes it valuable. The promontory commands the main shipping channel between the Gindrik Sea and the approach to Bonnetaz. Any power controlling the castle could effectively blockade Kuzagt trade.

The Kuzagt solve this problem by ensuring no one controls it. They patrol the waters nearby, discourage explorers, and spread stories emphasizing the castle's dangers. These stories are not exaggerated.

Periodically, ambitious captains or desperate refugees attempt to claim Castle Alexandr as a base of operations. The Kuzagt do not interfere. They simply wait. Within weeks—sometimes days—the new occupants are gone.

#### What Lies Beneath

The castle's cellars extend downward farther than the promontory's geology should allow. Explorers who have descended report passages that seem to continue indefinitely, opening into chambers of increasing size. The deepest reached—according to a Kuzagt expedition whose survivors refused to discuss their findings—contained seawater despite lying hundreds of feet below sea level.

Something lives in the depths. Or something sleeps there. Or something waits. The Kuzagt have sealed the cellar entrance with salt, bone, and old magic, and they check those seals regularly.

The castle remains standing. The seals remain intact. The Kuzagt consider this sufficient.

### Sandstorm Straits

Tags: strait, geography

A turbulent stretch of water separating the northeastern coast of the Sandreach from the mainland to the north. The straits take their name from the massive dust storms that blow off the Luquihn Desert and sweep across the water, reducing visibility to near zero and coating ships in layers of fine sand.

#### Navigation Hazards

The Sandstorm Straits present multiple dangers to shipping:

**Dust Storms**: The namesake phenomenon occurs when hot desert winds pick up sand from the Luquihn and carry it out to sea. These storms can last hours or days, forcing ships to anchor and wait them out—assuming they can find safe anchorage before the storm hits.

**Shallow Waters**: The straits are dotted with sandbars that shift unpredictably as currents and storms redistribute sediment. Charts of the straits are notoriously unreliable; local pilots who know the current conditions are essential for safe passage.

**Crosscurrents**: Where the strait narrows, conflicting tidal flows create dangerous crosscurrents that can push vessels off course or into shallow water.

#### Strategic Importance

Despite the hazards, the Sandstorm Straits see significant traffic. Ships traveling between the Greenwater Isles and the eastern coast must either brave the straits or take the much longer route around the northern cape. For merchants dealing in time-sensitive goods—or those trying to avoid attention—the straits offer a faster if riskier passage.

The lack of any major port along the strait means ships must carry enough supplies to wait out storms at anchor. This limitation keeps the straits relatively free of pirates, who prefer waters with more predictable shelter.

### Temple of the Sun

Tags: poi, ruin

An ancient temple complex in the central Luquihn Desert, south of the Dunes of Kalamesh. Unlike the destroyed Temple of Bryn near Belu Jenari, this temple remains largely intact—its builders constructed it from massive blocks of white stone that have resisted centuries of sandstorms.

The temple is dedicated to sun worship, though scholars debate which tradition built it. The architecture predates known human settlement in the region, and the carvings show stylized sun imagery that doesn't match any contemporary religious iconography. Some theorize it was built by an early Murazi surface civilization before they retreated underground; others attribute it to a forgotten human culture.

The interior remains sealed. The main entrance is blocked by a stone door covered in worn glyphs that have resisted all attempts at translation. Treasure hunters have tried to breach the walls, but the white stone is unnaturally hard—picks and chisels barely scratch it. Whatever secrets the Temple of the Sun holds, it guards them jealously.

### Ulkevolm

Tags: state, nation

A state in the Luquihn Desert region.

## Free Isles

### Geography

The Free Isles region encompasses both the famous trading city-states and the mysterious island of Xabraedia. Positioned between Upoceax to the southwest and Aboyinzu to the east (via Devil's Spine), this region serves as a critical crossroads for maritime trade across Alaria.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bay of Merchants
- **East**: Devil's Spine passage leads to Chaal Nazzerox (Aboyinzu)
- **South**: Strait of Curses, Unsettling Bay
- **West**: Scaley Sea, Belter Bay; Upoceax beyond

#### The Free Isles Proper

The western cluster of city-states is what most people mean when they speak of "the Free Isles." These islands are populated by diverse peoples—Chargon, Nyolci, Eloweir, Swuigrach, Craven, Ayblek, Shapers, and Qord'ik. The cities are massive trading ports that have attracted merchants from all over the world.

The cities are extremely colorful, beautiful places, but deadly if you stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Huge coliseums have been built for gladiatorial fights. Best of all the gladiators is Red, the Screaming Blade.

#### Xabraedia

The large island east of the city-states, separated by The Spout (a common but not primary shipping lane). Xabraedia is not typically what people think of as "the Free Isles," but it falls within this region geographically.

Notable features:
- **Veluminatic Forest**: The purple-tinged forest covering much of the island
- **Starfall**: A giant pool of energy from a different plane—a major point of supernatural interest
- **Morgwood**: Forest region in the northern part of the island

#### Surrounding Waters

- **Bay of Merchants**: Northern waters, major trade route
- **The Spout**: Channel between the Free Isles and Xabraedia
- **Scaley Sea**: Southwestern waters
- **Belter Bay**: Southwest
- **Unsettling Bay**: Southern waters
- **Strait of Curses**: South of Xabraedia
- **Devil's Spine**: Eastern passage to Aboyinzu

### Political Climate

The Free Isles operate without kings, councils, or any pretense of democracy. Each city-state is ruled by whichever family currently holds enough muscle, money, and blood-debt to keep the others in line. They call their leaders *patróns*—a title earned, not inherited, though dynasties form when a family stays vicious enough across generations.

#### The Five Families

The major cities aren't governed—they're *owned*. Five great families have consolidated power across the archipelago, each controlling one city-state as their seat of power while maintaining operations throughout the region:

- **The Valdrossi** of Kokotintin: The wealthiest and most powerful, their fingers in every port and every pocket
- **The Gattorini** of Mpehi: Golden and cursed, blessed by their chained dragon
- **The Torvachi** of Yibiye: Old magic, old grudges, guardians of the gates
- **The Marrovini** of Awobiso: Shipwrights and smugglers, masters of the western approach
- **The Velathi** of Hik: Teflin outcasts who found power in the purple light of Starfall

The families maintain a fragile peace through the *Patto di Sangue*—the Blood Pact—an agreement that disputes between families are settled in the arena, not the streets. This hasn't prevented assassinations, poisonings, and "accidents," but it keeps the ports open and the trade flowing.

#### The Arenas

Blood sport isn't entertainment in the Free Isles—it's law. Every city maintains at least one coliseum where grievances are settled, debts are paid, and the crowds are kept fed on spectacle. Gladiators are celebrities, slaves, criminals, and volunteers. The greatest of them become legends.

The current champion of the Free Isles is **Red, the Screaming Blade**—a massive Chargon woman who fights with twin curved swords and has never lost a bout. She's sponsored by the Valdrossi family but answers to no one. Killing her in the arena would be legal. Killing her outside it would start a war.

#### Freedom's Price

"Free" is a complicated word here. The Isles are officially abolitionist—escaped slaves from Kyagos and the Shacklands find refuge, and slave ships are seized in Free Isles waters. But freedom isn't free. Refugees often find themselves indentured to the families, working off "protection fees" and "passage debts" that mysteriously never shrink. Some end up in the arenas.

The families see no contradiction. You're free from chains. What you do with that freedom—including selling it back for security—is your business.

### What Makes It Interesting

**The wealth is obscene.** These are the richest cities in Upoceax, possibly in all of southern Alaria. Kokotintin's harbor sees more gold pass through in a month than some nations see in a decade. The architecture drips with opulence—gilded spires, marble colonnades, pleasure barges floating between canal-side palazzos. Merchants from every corner of Alaria jostle for position, and fortunes are made and lost before breakfast.

**The violence is normalized.** Gladiatorial combat isn't a curiosity—it's woven into daily life. Debts are settled in blood. Trials are conducted by combat. Entertainment is watching people die artfully. Children grow up betting on their favorite fighters. The families use the arenas to dispose of enemies legally, and the crowds love them for it.

**Everyone's playing an angle.** The mob families, the merchants, the gladiators, the escaped slaves, the foreign traders—everyone has something they want and something they're hiding. Trust is currency, and most people are broke. A street vendor might be a family informant. A gladiator might be an assassin waiting for orders. A refugee might be a spy from Kyagos.

**The dragon.** Bathemiel is chained beneath Mpehi, granting the Gattorini patrón the midas touch. This single advantage has kept the Gattorini in power for generations—but the dragon wants something, and whatever deal was struck is older than anyone alive remembers.

**The purple island.** Xabraedia looms to the east, touched by Starfall's alien energy. The Velathi of Hik have adapted to live near it, but the other families eye the island with a mixture of greed and fear. Whatever power Starfall offers, it's power they don't control.

### What Will Go Wrong

**Family war.** The Blood Pact is fraying. The Valdrossi have grown too powerful, and the other families are beginning to whisper about alliances. A single assassination could shatter the peace and turn the Isles into a bloodbath.

**Slave revolt.** The "freed" slaves who work off their debts are getting organized. Someone's been arming them, training them, and promising them real freedom. When they rise, the families will face an enemy that knows every back alley, every weakness, every dirty secret.

**The dragon's price.** Bathemiel's bargain is coming due. The Gattorini patrón has been having dreams—golden hands reaching from the earth, pulling him down. The dragon is patient, but it remembers everything.

**Starfall spreads.** The purple tinge of the Veluminante Forest has been creeping outward for decades. The Velathi say it's nothing. The other families have noticed that Velathi traders bleed a color that isn't quite red.

**Outside interest.** The wealth of the Free Isles has attracted attention from powers that don't play by local rules. Tarkhon traders have been making generous offers. Gorath sky-captains have been surveying the harbors. And someone's been asking questions about the Spire of Ascension—the one POI that leads outside the planar stack entirely.

### City-States

The Five Families control one city-state each:

- **Kokotintin** - Seat of the Valdrossi, wealthiest city in the Free Isles
- **Mpehi** - Seat of the Gattorini, the golden city built above a chained dragon
- **Yibiye** - Seat of the Torvachi, guarded by the awakening Gates
- **Awobiso** - Seat of the Marrovini, gatekeepers of the western approach
- **Hik** - Seat of the Velathi, teflin city on Xabraedia

### Notable Locations

- **Massacre Hills** - Haunted promontory near Yibiye, site of an ancient slaughter
- **Hills of the Damned** - Cursed territory near Awobiso, result of a failed spirit binding
- **Tower of Yprazi** - Sealed spire at the heart of the Hills of the Damned
- **Sunshine Meadows** - Cursed meadowy hills in the southern islands, filled with blinding creatures
- **Veluminante Forest** - Purple-tinged forest spreading from Starfall
- **Morglewood** - Normal forest serving as barrier against Starfall's influence
- **Starfall** - Pool of extraplanar energy at Xabraedia's center

### Awobiso

Tags: city, state, nation, free-isles

The gatekeepers of the Free Isles, where paranoia is policy and strangers are screened before they're welcomed. Awobiso sits at the western edge of the archipelago, the first port of call for ships arriving from Upoceax and the Scaley Sea. The Marrovini family has controlled this city for generations, building their power on shipyards, smuggling networks, and the simple fact that everyone passes through their waters first.

#### The City

Awobiso clings to a rocky island at the western approach, its harbor carved from the cliffs rather than naturally formed. The city rises in steep terraces from the waterline, every level defensible, every street designed with chokepoints in mind. From the sea, Awobiso looks like a fortress pretending to be a city. From inside, it feels like a city preparing for siege.

The architecture is functional, almost military—heavy stone, reinforced doors, narrow alleys that favor defenders. There's wealth here, but it's hidden behind practical façades. A merchant's palazzo might have gilded furniture inside, but the exterior looks like a barracks. The Marrovini don't believe in advertising what they have.

The harbor is smaller than the other cities', but its shipyards are the finest in the Free Isles. Awobiso builds the fastest smuggling craft, the most maneuverable patrol boats, and the most heavily armed merchant vessels in the region. If you want a ship that can outrun trouble, you commission it here.

#### The Approach

Ships entering the Free Isles from the west pass through Awobiso's waters first—and the Marrovini make sure they know it. A chain of guard towers stretches along the western approaches, manned day and night, signaling to the city with mirror flashes and flag codes. Unknown vessels are hailed, inspected, and either cleared or turned away. Resistance is met with fire ships.

This chokepoint gives the Marrovini leverage over the other families. Tariffs collected at the western approach are technically shared, but the Marrovini take their cut first. More importantly, they see everything that comes in—and sometimes, things that were supposed to arrive simply don't. The other families resent this control but haven't found a way to break it without starting a war.

#### The Marrovini Family

The Marrovini are shipwrights, smugglers, and paranoid geniuses. They trust no one outside the bloodline and barely trust each other. Family decisions are made in closed councils where every member is checked for weapons, poisons, and enchantments before entering. Secrets shared with a Marrovini stay with that Marrovini—they don't even tell each other everything.

**Don Jacopo Marrovini**, the current patrón, is a weathered man who spent thirty years at sea before taking the family seat. He still thinks like a captain—quick decisions, harsh discipline, no tolerance for failure. His paranoia is legendary; he changes sleeping chambers nightly, employs three food tasters, and hasn't left the city in twelve years.

The Marrovini maintain the Free Isles' most extensive smuggling network. Goods that can't pass through legitimate channels—weapons for rebels, substances for addicts, people who need to disappear—move through Marrovini hands. The other families know about it. They use it too often to object.

#### The Hills of the Damned

Southwest of Awobiso, visible from the highest terraces, the Hills of the Damned rise from the sea—a barren promontory where nothing grows and the soil itself seems wrong. The hills earned their name centuries ago, when a Marrovini patrón attempted to bind a powerful spirit to serve as a guardian, similar to Yibiye's Gates. The binding failed catastrophically.

Now the hills are haunted—genuinely, undeniably haunted. Spirits move through the rocks, wailing sounds carry across the water on still nights, and anyone who stays too long begins to hear voices offering terrible bargains. The Marrovini maintain a cordon of guard posts around the hills, not to protect them, but to keep what's inside from getting out.

The Tower of Yprazi stands at the center of the hills, a crooked spire of blackened stone that predates the failed binding and may have been its cause. No one knows what Yprazi was—a mage, a daemon, a title, a curse. The tower remains sealed, its single door unopened in living memory. The Marrovini don't discuss it.

#### The Arena

Awobiso's coliseum—the *Pozzo della Vendetta*, the Pit of Vengeance—is the smallest and grimmest of the Free Isles arenas. Fights here are personal: debts settled, grudges concluded, sentences carried out. There's no spectacle, no theater, just two people entering and one person leaving.

The Marrovini don't care about entertainment. They care about finality. The Pit serves as the family's court of last resort—disputes that can't be resolved by mediation, money, or threats end here. The fights are to the death by default. Mercy is considered weakness.

#### Economy

Awobiso's economy runs on shipbuilding, smuggling, and tariffs. The shipyards employ a significant portion of the population—skilled craftsmen who can build a hull that outpaces pursuit or reinforce a merchant vessel against pirates. Commissions come from across the Free Isles and beyond.

The smuggling operations are never discussed publicly but employ even more people. Awobiso has the expertise, the vessels, and the strategic position to move anything anywhere. The Marrovini take a percentage of everything that passes through their networks—and their networks are extensive.

Legitimate tariffs from the western approach provide steady income, but the real profit comes from what the Marrovini choose not to report to the other families. A ship carrying valuable cargo might be "inspected" and found to be carrying somewhat less than its manifest claimed. The difference ends up in Marrovini warehouses.

#### What Travelers Should Know

- Every ship entering the Free Isles stops here first. Cooperation makes the process faster.
- The Marrovini see everything. Attempting to hide cargo is possible but expensive.
- Do not ask about the Hills of the Damned. Do not approach the Hills of the Damned. Do not acknowledge the Hills of the Damned exist if you can help it.
- Commissioning a ship takes time. The craftsmen don't rush, and the Marrovini don't pressure them.
- The Pit of Vengeance is not entertainment. Tourists who treat it as such sometimes end up participating.

### Bturi's Tomb

Tags: poi, dungeon

Dungeon tomb of a lich king, filled with a lot of treasure. Bturi was a master of flesh.

### Dungeon of Flowers

Tags: poi, dungeon

Filled with flowers that never decay. Lots of things frozen in rot. Rot-queen hag lives within. Brilliant, corrupted light throughout.

### Hik

Tags: citystate, free-isles, teflin

The city at the edge of the impossible, where exiles built a kingdom in the shadow of alien light. Hik sits on the western shore of Xabraedia, separated from the main Free Isles by The Spout and from normal reality by proximity to Starfall. The Velathi family—teflin outcasts who found refuge here generations ago—have adapted to the purple influence in ways that unsettle the other families. Their blood runs colors that aren't quite right, and their eyes see things they shouldn't.

#### The City

Hik occupies a crescent harbor on Xabraedia's western coast, positioned to trade with the main Free Isles while keeping Starfall at their backs. The city is smaller than the other Free Isles capitals but denser, buildings pressed close together in a maze of narrow streets and covered passages. The architecture shows teflin influences—geometric patterns, angular rooflines, windows placed for light at odd hours.

The most striking feature is the illumination. At night, Hik glows faintly purple, the residual light of Starfall filtering through the Veluminante Forest and reflecting off polished surfaces throughout the city. Locals have adapted; visitors find it unsettling. The light is stronger closer to the forest edge, and the oldest parts of the city—nearest the interior—are visibly affected. Plants grow in wrong shapes. Shadows move without sources. Some walls seem to breathe.

The harbor is well-defended but welcoming to trade. Ships from across the Free Isles dock here regularly, though sailors rarely venture beyond the harbor district. The Velathi encourage this boundary—the inner city, they say, takes time to understand.

#### The Velathi Family

The Velathi are teflin—the horned peoples whose daemon ancestry makes them outcasts in most of Alaria. Centuries ago, a teflin community fleeing persecution found Xabraedia and its strange purple pool. Rather than avoid Starfall, they embraced proximity to it. The energy changed them, slowly, over generations. Now the Velathi are something more than teflin, or something less—depending on who you ask.

**Donna Seraveth Velathi**, the current patrón, has skin that shimmers with undertones of purple and eyes that occasionally reflect things that aren't there. She speaks rarely, communicates through trusted intermediaries, and has been known to answer questions before they're asked. The other families find her deeply unnerving. This is intentional.

The Velathi operate differently from the other families. Hierarchy is less rigid, decisions more collective, enforcement more... subtle. People who cross the Velathi don't die publicly. They change their minds, forget their plans, wake up somewhere they didn't mean to be. The family's connection to Starfall has given them access to abilities the other families can't counter or understand.

#### Starfall's Influence

The Velathi's power comes from their relationship with Starfall—the pool of extraplanar energy left by the disintegrated sky worm from Glyssen. They don't worship it, exactly, but they've learned to live with it in ways no one else has managed.

Those born in Hik, especially those with Velathi blood, develop minor adaptations: enhanced night vision, sensitivity to psychic impressions, the occasional precognitive flash. The deeper you go into the city, the stronger these effects become. The Velathi leadership, who spend time in the Veluminante Forest itself, develop abilities that approach the supernatural. Some can taste lies. Some can see through walls. Some can make people forget they were ever there.

The cost is visible. Velathi blood isn't quite red—it has a purple-brown tint that disturbs doctors from other cities. Their shadows sometimes move independently. Their oldest members sometimes speak in languages no one recognizes. The other families have noticed. They're not sure what to do about it.

#### The Arena

Hik doesn't have a traditional coliseum. Instead, it has the *Labirinto delle Ombre*, the Labyrinth of Shadows—a sprawling maze-arena built into the edge of the Veluminante Forest, where the purple light is strongest and reality is most flexible.

Fights in the Labyrinth are strange. The maze reconfigures between bouts. Shadows interfere unpredictably. Some combatants report fighting opponents who weren't there, or seeing things in the corners that watched without participating. Deaths are rare—the Labyrinth doesn't seem to want them—but the experience changes people. Champions from other cities who compete in Hik often refuse to return.

The crowds watch from elevated platforms around the maze's perimeter, betting not just on who will win but on what will happen. "Three shadow interventions in the first round" pays twelve to one. "Victor emerges speaking backwards" pays forty to one. It happened once.

#### Economy

Hik's economy runs on exotic goods, strange services, and carefully managed fear. The city trades in substances and materials found nowhere else—luminescent fungi from the Veluminante, minerals affected by Starfall's energy, preserved specimens of creatures that shouldn't exist. Alchemists, occultists, and desperate scholars pay premium prices.

The Velathi also offer services the other families can't: information extraction through psychic means, memory modification, the removal of inconvenient recollections. These services are expensive, discreet, and absolutely never discussed publicly. Clients arrive by appointment, leave by arrangement, and rarely remember the details clearly.

Trade with the main Free Isles is steady but wary. Ships dock, load cargo, and leave quickly. The Velathi don't take offense. They prefer visitors who know their limits.

#### Morglwood

North of Hik, the Morglwood provides a buffer between the city and the northern coast. Unlike the purple-tinged Veluminante to the south, Morglwood is a relatively normal forest—dense, dark, but unmutated. The Velathi harvest timber here, hunt game, and maintain it as proof that not everything about Xabraedia is strange.

Local legend claims Morglwood was planted deliberately to contain Starfall's spread, roots woven with protective bindings to keep the purple light from reaching the northern shore. The Velathi neither confirm nor deny this. The forest does seem to end very abruptly at its southern edge.

#### The Veluminante

South of Hik, stretching toward Starfall, the Veluminante Forest glows with alien light. Trees twist in impossible spirals, bioluminescent fungi carpet the forest floor, and the wildlife has adapted in unsettling ways. The Velathi enter the forest regularly; outsiders are strongly discouraged.

Those who enter without Velathi guidance often don't return. Those who do return aren't always unchanged. The forest seems to respond to intention—hostile visitors encounter hostile phenomena, while those the Velathi vouch for find the path clearer. Some theorize the forest is semi-sentient, a colony organism affected by Starfall's energy. The Velathi say it's just the forest. They smile when they say it.

#### What Travelers Should Know

- Stay in the harbor district unless you have Velathi permission to go further.
- The purple light is not harmful in small doses. Probably.
- Don't stare at Velathi shadows. They notice.
- Trading for Starfall-affected goods is legal but complicated. Bring documentation.
- The Labyrinth of Shadows is not for tourists. Spectating is fine. Participating is ill-advised.
- If a Velathi gives you advice, follow it. They rarely warn people twice.

### Kokotintin

Tags: city, state, nation, free-isles

The jewel of the Free Isles and the wealthiest city in southern Alaria. Kokotintin is a sprawling metropolis of canals, marble palaces, and blood-soaked arenas where fortunes change hands faster than the tides. It is the seat of the Valdrossi family—the most powerful of the Five Families—and the undisputed commercial capital of the archipelago.

#### The City

Kokotintin occupies the largest island in the central Free Isles cluster, its natural harbor expanded over centuries into a labyrinth of artificial channels that allow ships to dock directly at merchant warehouses. The city rises in tiers from the waterline—dockside markets at the bottom, merchant quarters in the middle, and the palatial estates of the wealthy crowning the central hill. The Valdrossi palazzo dominates the summit, its gilded dome visible from any point in the harbor.

The architecture is ostentatious by design. Marble façades, bronze fixtures, murals depicting trade victories and arena champions. Every building competes to display wealth, because in Kokotintin, appearance *is* wealth. A merchant whose palazzo looks shabby won't get contracts. A family whose gondolas look cheap won't get respect.

Canals serve as streets. Gondolas and cargo barges crowd the waterways, poled by indentured oarsmen who know every shortcut and every family's territory. The poor live in floating houseboats or cramped rooms above the waterline, packed into buildings that lean dangerously over the canals. When it rains, the lower levels flood. No one with money notices.

#### The Grand Coliseum

The *Arena Valdrossi*—commonly called the Grand Coliseum—is the largest gladiatorial arena in the Free Isles and possibly in all of Upoceax. It seats forty thousand and is rarely less than half full. The games run almost daily: morning bouts for amateurs and criminals, afternoon matches for professional gladiators, evening spectacles featuring exotic beasts, mass battles, or high-profile duels.

The arena floor can be flooded for naval recreations, fitted with obstacles for hunt scenarios, or stripped bare for formal combat. Beneath the floor, a warren of cells, training rooms, and beast pens houses the fighters and creatures waiting their turn. The tunnels connect to the canal system—bodies go out, fresh fighters come in.

**Red, the Screaming Blade** fights here most often, though she appears at other arenas for special events. Her matches always sell out. Betting on her fights moves more gold than some merchant fleets.

#### The Valdrossi Family

The Valdrossi have ruled Kokotintin for four generations, and they intend to rule it for four more. Their power comes from three sources: control of the harbor master's office (every ship pays them tariffs), ownership of the Grand Coliseum (every bet pays them percentages), and a network of informants that makes secrets expensive.

**Don Emilio Valdrossi**, the current patrón, is a heavyset man in his sixties who presents himself as a jovial grandfather while running the most ruthless organization in the Free Isles. He rarely raises his voice. He doesn't need to. When Don Emilio is disappointed, people disappear into the canals. When he's pleased, fortunes are made.

The Valdrossi maintain relationships with every major trading power in the region—Gorath, Bonnetaz, Tarkhon, even cautious exchanges with Kyagos through intermediaries. They're pragmatic about profit and utterly ruthless about threats. The other families resent their dominance but fear a direct challenge.

#### Economy

Everything passes through Kokotintin. Silks from Ve, metals from the Shacklands, spices from the Greenwater Isles, manufactured goods from Tarkhon, mercenaries from anywhere with hungry swords. The city takes a cut of every transaction through tariffs, docking fees, warehouse rentals, and protection payments.

The legitimate economy is vast, but the gray economy is larger. Smuggling, black-market goods, stolen cargo, and "redirected" shipments all flow through channels the Valdrossi pretend not to control. Fencing operations move goods that fell off ships. Money lenders offer rates that look reasonable until you miss a payment. Brothels, gambling houses, and drug dens operate openly, paying their licenses to the family.

Kokotintin's guilds—the Merchant Consortium, the Longshoremen's Brotherhood, the Gondoliers' Union—are all family fronts. Union dues go to the Valdrossi. Guild contracts favor Valdrossi partners. Cross the guild, cross the family.

#### Districts

**The Spires**: The wealthy hilltop district where the great families maintain their palazzos. Quiet streets, private docks, and guards who ask questions with crossbows.

**Merchant's Rest**: The commercial heart of the city—warehouses, trading houses, counting houses, and the Consortium Hall where deals are struck and broken.

**The Canals**: Everything below the waterline. Markets, taverns, fighting pits, pleasure houses, and the cramped homes of the working poor. This is where refugees end up, where debts are worked off, and where people vanish.

**The Coliseum Quarter**: Built around the Grand Coliseum—gladiator schools, betting houses, weapon smiths, and the celebratory rowdiness that surrounds the games.

**The Floats**: A floating district of houseboats, barges, and improvised platforms connected by rope bridges. Home to the poorest, the newest arrivals, and those hiding from someone.

#### What Travelers Should Know

- Every gondolier is a potential informant. Watch what you say on the water.
- The games run daily. Missing the evening bout is considered odd.
- Debts are enforceable. Don't borrow what you can't repay.
- Refugees are "welcome" but expected to work. Ask about terms *before* accepting help.
- Don Emilio is always listening. Even when he's not.

### Morglewood

Tags: forest, geography, free-isles, xabraedia

The northern forest of Xabraedia, standing as a buffer between the city of Hik and the island's northern coast. Unlike the purple-tinged Veluminante to the south, Morglewood is a relatively normal forest—dense, dark, and unmutated. Its existence is a mystery and possibly a miracle.

#### Nature

Morglewood is a temperate forest of ordinary composition: oak-analogues, evergreens, ferns, and underbrush that would seem unremarkable anywhere else in Alaria. The trees grow tall and close, creating a permanent twilight beneath the canopy. Wildlife behaves normally. Plants follow expected patterns. The soil is ordinary soil.

This normalcy is deeply strange given Morglewood's proximity to Starfall and the Veluminante. The purple forest ends at a sharp boundary running east-west across Xabraedia's interior, and Morglewood begins immediately north of that line. There's no gradual transition, no partially affected zone—just the Veluminante's spiraling, glowing trees, then a clear demarcation, then ordinary forest.

The Velathi maintain that Morglwood is proof not everything about Xabraedia is changed. Outsiders suspect the forest's normality is deliberate—that something was done, long ago, to keep Starfall's influence from spreading north.

#### The Barrier Theory

According to local legend, Morglewood was planted deliberately by the first Velathi settlers—or by someone even older—to contain Starfall's spread. The roots were woven with protective bindings, the soil treated with neutralizing agents, the trees selected specifically for their resistance to extraplanar contamination. The forest itself serves as a living wall against the purple tide.

Evidence for this theory includes:
- The unnaturally sharp boundary between Morglewood and the Veluminante
- Unusual patterns in the oldest trees' growth rings, suggesting synchronized planting
- Buried structures at the forest's southern edge that might be foundation stones for old wards
- The forest's stubborn resistance to the Veluminante's expansion despite centuries of proximity

The Velathi neither confirm nor deny the barrier theory. They simply ensure Morglewood is maintained—harvesting selectively, replanting where trees fall, and quietly removing anything that shows signs of purple influence.

#### Resources

Hik depends on Morglewood for ordinary timber, game, and foraged goods—the practical materials that the Veluminante cannot provide. The forest supports hunting lodges, lumber camps, and harvesting operations run by Velathi family members or trusted associates. Outsiders can obtain permits to enter Morglewood, unlike the Veluminante, though they're expected to report any unusual observations.

The contrast between the two forests makes Morglewood valuable in ways beyond resources. Visitors to Hik sometimes arrange forest walks specifically to remind themselves that normal exists. Scholars studying Starfall's influence use Morglewood as a control sample. And the Velathi themselves retreat to the northern forest when the purple light becomes too intense, using it as a place to remember what unaffected reality feels like.

#### The Northern Coast

Beyond Morglewood, Xabraedia's northern coast faces the Bay of Merchants—ordinary water, ordinary shores, theoretically accessible to anyone. In practice, the Velathi control access through Hik's harbor and discourage independent landings. They claim it's for visitors' protection; the forest can be confusing, and the route to Hik requires guidance. The real reason is less clear.

The northern coast shows no signs of Starfall's influence. This might mean the barrier worked. It might also mean the influence is spreading in a different direction. The Velathi watch the coast carefully and don't explain why.

### Mpehi

Tags: city, state, nation, free-isles

The city of gold and chains, where a dragon sleeps beneath the streets and the ruling family's touch turns flesh to metal. Mpehi is the second wealthiest of the Free Isles city-states, and the most feared. The Gattorini family has held power here for longer than anyone can count, bound to their patron Bathemiel by a bargain whose terms have been forgotten—but whose price is still being paid.

#### The City

Mpehi sprawls across a cluster of connected islets linked by bridges of gold-veined stone. The architecture is heavy, fortress-like, built from dark volcanic rock quarried from the island's interior—but every surface gleams with gilded ornamentation. Gold leaf covers domes, lines doorframes, traces patterns on street cobblestones. The effect is gaudy, overwhelming, deliberately intimidating. This is a city that wants you to know it could buy you.

The streets are narrow and winding, designed centuries ago to confuse invaders. Old fortifications have been converted into pleasure houses and gambling dens, arrow slits now windows for watching the crowds below. The harbor is smaller than Kokotintin's but fiercely defended—chain booms can seal it in minutes, and the watchtowers are always manned.

Beneath the city, in caverns that predate human settlement, Bathemiel sleeps. The dragon's presence can be felt in subtle ways: warmth rising through the stones, a faint vibration during deep night, the occasional tremor that sends gold-plated fixtures rattling. The Gattorini palazzo sits directly above the primary cavern. They call it the Golden Seat.

#### Bathemiel

The dragon came to these islands in the Second Eon, when the world was younger and the Free Isles were uninhabited rock. No one knows why Bathemiel chose to stay, or what wounded it so badly that it needed to sleep. When humans arrived, they found the dragon already chained—great bonds of dull gray metal that resist all attempts at identification, anchored to the cavern walls by mechanisms no one has been able to understand.

The first Gattorini patrón made a deal. The exact terms are lost, recorded only in a sealed vault that subsequent patróns have been unable (or unwilling) to open. What remains is the gift: the ruling patrón of Mpehi can transform any non-living matter they touch into pure gold. The effect is permanent and irreversible.

The gift has made the Gattorini unimaginably wealthy—but it has costs. Every patrón eventually goes mad, convinced that gold is spreading through their own flesh. Several have died clawing at their skin, certain they were transforming. Others have become paranoid about touch, refusing to remove their gloves even in private. The current patrón, **Donna Serephina Gattorini**, wears golden gauntlets at all times and has not touched another living being in fifteen years.

Bathemiel occasionally speaks through dreams. The messages are cryptic, unsettling, and never helpful. The dragon seems to be waiting for something. The Gattorini have learned not to ask what.

#### The Gattorini Family

The Gattorini are the oldest of the Five Families, and the strangest. Their obsession with gold extends beyond wealth—they believe it purifies, protects, sanctifies. Family members are ritually gilded at important life moments: gold leaf pressed to the forehead at birth, golden jewelry bonded to the flesh at coming-of-age, golden death masks sealed over faces before burial. The family crypt is said to contain centuries of golden corpses.

**Donna Serephina** rules with cold efficiency, maintaining Mpehi's position through calculated marriages, strategic violence, and the ever-present threat of her touch. Cross her, and your most prized possession becomes worthless gold—your ship's wheel, your heirloom blade, your wife's portrait. She rarely needs to demonstrate twice.

The family maintains a corps of golden-masked enforcers called the *Mani d'Oro*—the Golden Hands. They're recognizable by their gilded masks, golden gauntlets, and absolute silence. They don't make threats. They make examples.

#### The Arena

Mpehi's coliseum—the *Fossa d'Oro*, the Golden Pit—is smaller than Kokotintin's but more brutal. The fights here tend toward lethality; survival rates are lower, and the crowds prefer decisive endings. The arena floor is sprinkled with gold dust before each match, turning the sand glittering and slick.

Gladiators who please the Donna receive gilded weapons and armor—worthless for combat but invaluable as status symbols. Champions are sometimes offered a choice: a fortune in gold, or one touch from the Donna's bare hand on an object of their choosing. Most take the fortune. The smart ones take the touch.

#### Economy

Mpehi's economy runs on gold and fear. The Gattorini don't need to trade—they can create wealth from nothing—but they choose to, maintaining the pretense of legitimate commerce. Their real power comes from lending: Gattorini gold funds half the merchant ventures in the Free Isles, and the interest rates are murderous. Default, and the Mani d'Oro come calling.

The city also specializes in luxury goods: goldsmiths, jewelers, artisans who work with precious metals. Rich merchants from across Alaria commission work here, paying premium prices for the prestige of Mpehi craftsmanship. Much of this gold is transformed by the Donna personally, guaranteeing authenticity.

#### The Dragon's Price

Bathemiel's bargain is coming due. Donna Serephina has begun dreaming of golden hands—her own hands—reaching up from the earth and pulling her down into the caverns. The dreams are getting more frequent. The dragon's messages, once cryptic, have become demands: *bring me the blood of a willing sacrifice. Bring me a soul that chooses the chain.*

The Donna hasn't told her family. She's been quietly researching alternatives—ancient texts, planar scholars, anyone who might know how to break a dragon's bargain. So far, nothing. The Gattorini have been paying Bathemiel's price for centuries. Soon, someone will have to pay the principal.

### Spire of Ascension

Tags: poi

A giant pinnacle on a massive, ornate base. Must perform hefty sacrifice and know your own true name, but takes you directly outside the Alarian planar stack.

### Sunshine Meadows

Tags: plains, geography, free-isles, dungeon

Cursed meadowy hills on the southern islands of the Free Isles, where the sun burns brighter than it should and the creatures have learned to use that light as a weapon. Sunshine Meadows is home to four significant points of interest—ancient tombs and strange structures that draw treasure-seekers, scholars, and fools from across Alaria.

#### Nature

The meadows occupy a chain of islands south of Kokotintin, connected by sandbars at low tide and isolated during high water. The terrain is rolling grassland broken by rocky outcrops, wildflower patches, and the occasional twisted tree. It looks pleasant from a distance—pastoral, even inviting. This is a trap.

The sun here is wrong. Light falls heavier, sharper, more intense than in surrounding areas. Shadows are crisp-edged and seem to resist movement. The animals have adapted: many species have developed bioluminescent organs, reflective scales, or eye structures that can focus and redirect sunlight. Encounter the wrong creature at the wrong angle, and you're blinded—temporarily or permanently.

Local guides wear smoked glass over their eyes and recommend visitors do the same. Expeditions time their travel for dawn and dusk, when the light is manageable. Midday in Sunshine Meadows is genuinely dangerous; the creatures are most active, the light is most intense, and travelers have been known to walk in circles for hours, unable to see through the glare.

#### Kokotintin's Interest

The Valdrossi of Kokotintin control access to the meadows, funding expeditions and taking a substantial cut of any recovered treasures. They maintain supply posts on the northern islands and employ guides who know the safer routes. The family's interest is purely financial—the dungeons below are lucrative, and controlling access means controlling the wealth that emerges.

Adventurer companies operating in Sunshine Meadows pay licensing fees, deposit bonds against expected returns, and submit to "inspection" of recovered goods before leaving the area. The Valdrossi take their percentage, provide healing services at marked-up rates, and maintain just enough infrastructure to keep the treasure flowing. They have no interest in exploring the dungeons themselves. That's what expendable adventurers are for.

#### Tomb of Braggus Solas

The greatest light mage to have ever lived, Braggus Solas chose to be interred in Sunshine Meadows—or perhaps was already here, and the meadows' strange properties are a consequence of his presence. The tomb is a massive underground complex of polished stone and crystalline chambers, lit by eternal flames that cast no shadows.

The tomb is a powerful point of affinity for light magic. Practitioners report their spells amplified, their connection to Kunus (the plane of light) strengthened, their understanding expanded. The tomb also defends itself aggressively. Traps of focused light, guardian constructs of crystallized radiance, and wards that turn intruders' own vision against them have claimed many explorers.

Recovered artifacts from Braggus Solas's tomb command extraordinary prices among mages, collectors, and institutions. The Valdrossi have standing bounties for specific items rumored to remain inside.

#### Dungeon of Flowers

A sprawling underground complex filled with flowers that never decay, frozen in perfect bloom despite the absence of light or water. The dungeon is beautiful and deeply wrong—time itself seems to have stopped, or perhaps reversed, creating a space where rot cannot complete its work.

A rot-queen hag lives within, surrounded by things frozen at the moment of their decay: half-eaten meals, slowly-falling water, blood that never quite dries. The hag is ancient, possibly immortal, sustained by the dungeon's refusal to let anything fully die. She trades in knowledge, bargains, and curses, but her prices are always more than they seem.

Brilliant, corrupted light fills the dungeon—not sunlight, not torchlight, but something that illuminates without warming. Explorers report headaches, nausea, and a persistent sense of being preserved against their will.

#### Bturi's Tomb

The burial place of a lich king who mastered flesh-shaping magic before his transformation to undeath. Bturi was said to reshape his own body at will, growing extra limbs, altering his features, becoming whatever form suited his purposes. His tomb is filled with the results of his experiments—preserved bodies in various states of modification, failed attempts at perfect forms, and treasure accumulated across centuries of magical research.

The tomb is heavily trapped and still defended by constructs of shaped flesh—things that were once human, or several humans, or pieces of many humans assembled into something functional. The lich himself may or may not still exist somewhere in the lower levels; explorers who venture too deep don't return to report.

The treasure is substantial. Bturi accumulated wealth the way other mages accumulate knowledge, seeing gold and gems as materials for transformation rather than currency. His hoard includes items transformed partially into flesh, coins that beat like hearts, and jewelry that whispers in dead languages.

#### Spire of Ascension

The strangest of the four sites—a giant pinnacle rising from an ornate base, constructed of materials that resist identification. The Spire was not built by any known civilization, and its purpose is singular: it offers an exit from the Alarian planar stack entirely.

Reaching the Spire's apex requires two things: a hefty sacrifice of blood and treasure, and knowledge of your own true name. Meet both conditions, and the Spire opens—a doorway to somewhere outside the fourteen planes, outside the three suns' influence, outside everything that constitutes normal reality. No one knows where the doorway leads. Few who enter have returned.

Those who have returned are... different. They speak of spaces without direction, of entities that exist across multiple dimensions simultaneously, of time moving in patterns that human minds weren't designed to process. They're usually institutionalized shortly after sharing these observations.

The other families are aware of the Spire and deeply concerned about it. Access to an exit from the planar stack could be leveraged in ways they can't predict or counter. Someone has been making inquiries—not the Valdrossi, not any known power, but someone with resources and interest. The Valdrossi have quietly increased security around the Spire's approaches. They're not sure what they're guarding against.

### Tomb of Braggus Solas

Tags: poi, dungeon

Dungeon tomb of the greatest light mage to have ever lived. Very powerful point of affinity.

### Veluminante Forest

Tags: forest, geography, free-isles, xabraedia

The purple-tinged forest that covers much of Xabraedia's interior, spreading outward from Starfall like a slow infection. The Veluminante glows faintly at night, its bioluminescent life forms creating an eerie luminescence that can be seen from ships passing through The Spout. The Velathi of Hik enter the forest regularly; outsiders are strongly advised not to.

#### Nature

The Veluminante is not a normal forest. The trees grow in spiraling patterns, their bark shot through with veins of faintly luminescent material. Fungi carpet the forest floor in colors that don't exist elsewhere—purples that shade toward ultraviolet, blues that seem to recede rather than reflect. The air tastes different inside the treeline: metallic, slightly sweet, with an aftertaste that lingers for hours.

Wildlife has adapted in unsettling ways. Deer-analogues move silently, their eyes reflecting the purple light. Birds sing in frequencies that affect the listener's equilibrium. Insects pulse with internal light, creating constellations among the undergrowth. Nothing here is dangerous in the conventional sense—predators exist, but they're no more aggressive than elsewhere. The danger is subtler.

Extended exposure to the Veluminante changes visitors. Small changes at first: vivid dreams, sensitivity to light, a tendency to lose track of time. Longer exposure produces stranger effects—perceiving things that haven't happened yet, hearing thoughts that aren't your own, bleeding in colors that aren't quite right. The Velathi have lived with these changes for generations. Outsiders rarely adapt as gracefully.

#### The Starfall Connection

The forest's strange properties flow from Starfall—the pool of extraplanar energy at Xabraedia's center. The remnant of a sky worm from the distant planar stack of Glyssen, Starfall radiates energy that the Veluminante has absorbed and distributed throughout its ecosystem. The forest is, in a sense, a processing system for Starfall's influence—channeling the alien energy into forms that are merely strange rather than immediately lethal.

The closer one travels to Starfall, the more intense the effects become. Trees near the pool's edge have crystallized into glass-like structures. The ground pulses with visible veins of purple light. The air itself becomes thick with psychic static, making thought difficult for unprepared minds. The Velathi have mapped safe routes through the forest, but these routes change, and the forest doesn't share its logic with outsiders.

#### Spread

The Veluminante has been growing for centuries, slowly expanding its borders as Starfall's influence seeps outward. The purple tinge that marks affected vegetation creeps a few hundred feet further each decade. The Morglewood to the north appears to serve as a barrier—whether natural or constructed—but the western shore has no such protection. Old maps show the treeline significantly closer to Starfall than current observations indicate.

The other Free Isles families have noticed. They've begun quiet discussions about what happens when the Veluminante reaches Hik's walls, or spreads to the harbor, or begins affecting the waters of The Spout. The Velathi insist the spread is slowing, that equilibrium is approaching. The Velathi also have purple-tinged blood and shadows that move independently. Their reassurances are not entirely comforting.

#### What Lives Here

The Velathi harvest materials from the Veluminante that exist nowhere else: luminescent fungi for alchemical purposes, crystallized sap with unusual magical properties, specimens of adapted wildlife for study. They trade these goods through Hik's harbor, commanding premium prices from desperate scholars and adventurous merchants.

Something else lives in the deeper forest, near Starfall itself. The Velathi don't discuss it. They simply don't travel to certain areas, and they become very quiet when outsiders ask why. The few expeditions that have ignored these boundaries and returned at all brought back fragmented accounts of structures that weren't built by human hands, patterns in the light that suggested intelligence, and a profound sense of being watched by something that existed partially outside normal perception.

#### Starfall

At the center of Xabraedia lies Starfall—a pool of intense, otherworldly energy unlike anything else on Alaria. The pool contains starblood, a substance that glows with a deep, alien purple-red color and twinkles with inner lights. This energy comes from a distant planar stack, having naturally coalesced here in a phenomenon that defies normal magical understanding.

The starblood is the remnant of a massive sky worm that escaped its home plane of Glyssen and came to Alaria, where it was promptly disintegrated by a coalition of titans. The creature's blood pooled here, barely contained on this plane. When removed from the pool, the substance begins teleporting back toward Glyssen—it cannot exist far from the pool's location.

Sometimes, people who enter the pool never come back, drawn into the alien energy or pulled toward the distant plane from which the starblood originates. The pool remains a site of mystery, danger, and otherworldly power.

### Yibiye

Tags: city, state, nation, free-isles

The warded city, where ancient magic guards the harbor and old grudges run deeper than the sea. Yibiye is the northernmost of the Free Isles city-states, positioned near the Massacre Hills—a name that tells its own story. The Torvachi family has held this city for centuries, and they remember every slight, every betrayal, every drop of blood that bought their walls.

#### The City

Yibiye occupies a defensible island at the northern edge of the Free Isles cluster, its harbor mouth narrow enough to chain and its hills steep enough to fortify. The city is older than the others, built on foundations that predate the current inhabitants—cyclopean stone blocks, channels of uncertain purpose, carvings in no known language. The Torvachi built on top of what they found and try not to dig too deep.

The architecture is practical rather than ostentatious. Stone walls, iron fittings, narrow windows that double as arrow slits. Where Kokotintin gleams and Mpehi glitters, Yibiye broods. The wealthiest districts are still fortress-like, their palazzos designed for siege. Gardens grow on rooftops, fed by ancient aqueducts. Underground cisterns store enough water for years.

The city's position near the Massacre Hills and the Bay of Merchants makes it strategically vital—and historically bloody. Yibiye has been attacked more often than any other Free Isles city. It has never fallen. The Gates are one reason. The Torvachi's long memory is another.

#### The Gates of Yibiye

Two colossal statues stand at the entrance to Yibiye's harbor, moss-covered stone figures rising eighty feet above the waterline. They appear ancient, weather-worn, vaguely humanoid but proportioned wrong—too long in the arms, too broad in the shoulders, faces worn smooth by centuries of salt spray. Local legend claims they were here before humans arrived, already standing sentinel over the harbor mouth.

The legends are true. When Yibiye faces a credible threat, the Gates awaken. The stone cracks, the moss falls away, and the statues move with terrible purpose, defending the harbor with fists that can shatter hulls and voices that can shatter minds. The awakening has happened eleven times in recorded history. No attacking fleet has survived.

The Torvachi maintain the Gates through rituals passed down through generations. The exact nature of the binding is a family secret, but it requires sacrifice—willing blood, given freely, once per generation. Young Torvachi compete for the honor. Not all survive the selection.

#### The Torvachi Family

The Torvachi are the oldest bloodline in the Free Isles, and they never let anyone forget it. Their family records go back further than any other, meticulously documenting alliances, betrayals, debts, and offenses. Cross a Torvachi, and your grandchildren will still be paying for it.

**Don Aurelio Torvachi**, the current patrón, is a thin, precise man who speaks softly and forgets nothing. He maintains files on every significant person in the Free Isles—their secrets, their weaknesses, their families. He rarely uses this information directly. He prefers to wait, letting debts accumulate interest until the moment of maximum leverage.

The Torvachi are the family others come to for mediation. Their reputation for fairness is real—they don't take sides, they take notes. When the Blood Pact needs enforcement, the Torvachi provide witnesses. When deals need guaranteeing, Torvachi seals are accepted throughout the Isles. This neutrality makes them invaluable, but it also makes them targets. The other families resent their access to everyone's secrets.

#### The Arena

Yibiye's coliseum—the *Teatro del Sangue*, the Theater of Blood—is smaller than Kokotintin's and less fatal than Mpehi's, but it has its own character: theatrical, dramatic, focused on spectacle over slaughter. Fights here are choreographed as much as contested, with elaborate costumes, musical accompaniment, and crowd-participation elements. Deaths are rare but meaningful.

The Torvachi see the arena as a tool for social management. Grudges that might otherwise fester find outlet in sponsored bouts. Disputes that might turn violent are channeled into formal duels. The family takes a cut of every bet, every concession, every sponsorship—but the real value is in the control. People focused on the games aren't focused on rebellion.

#### The Massacre Hills

Northeast of Yibiye, the Massacre Hills rise from the sea—a rocky promontory that has earned its name repeatedly. Three centuries ago, an invasion fleet from Kyagos landed there, intending to take Yibiye and establish a foothold in the Free Isles. The Torvachi met them with the Gates awakened and a month's preparation. Fifteen thousand soldiers died in the hills. Their bones are still there, visible when the rain washes the soil.

The Massacre Hills are considered cursed by some, sacred by others. The Torvachi maintain a modest monument at the landing site—not triumphant, but quiet, acknowledging the dead without celebrating them. Some claim the hills are haunted, that the screams of dying soldiers can still be heard on stormy nights. The Torvachi don't confirm or deny.

#### Economy

Yibiye's economy is built on information, mediation, and the long game. The city hosts the Free Isles' only formal banking consortium—the *Banca delle Memorie*, the Bank of Memories—which holds debts, guarantees contracts, and maintains records that no individual family could be trusted with. The Torvachi own the bank. The other families pretend they don't.

The city also profits from its strategic position near the Bay of Merchants. Ships passing through often stop at Yibiye for provisions, repairs, and the kind of neutral ground where deals can be struck without family interference. The harbor fees are reasonable. The information gathered from visitors is priceless.

#### What Travelers Should Know

- The Gates are always watching. Approach the harbor with proper signals or don't approach at all.
- Never insult a Torvachi. They'll be polite about it. They'll also remember.
- The Massacre Hills are not a tourist destination. Locals become very quiet when outsiders ask about them.
- The Theater of Blood offers safer entertainment than other arenas. "Safer" is relative.
- Banking at the Banca delle Memorie means the Torvachi will know your business. They know it anyway. At least this way you get interest.

## Sandreach Mountains

### Geography

The Sand Reach Mountains are the vast central mountain range of Upoceax, positioned south of the Sand Reach desert. This is an extensive mountainous region containing several states and serving as the geographic heart of the continent.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Sand Reach desert
- **East**: Extends toward Sequestria and the eastern coast
- **South**: The Giant Lands and Wycendeula
- **West**: Intersects with the Kelder Mountains (the north-south range)

#### Relationship to Other Ranges

The Sand Reach Mountains bisect the Kelder Mountains where they meet on the western side—the Kelder running north-south, the Sand Reach running more or less east-west. This intersection creates a complex mountain junction in the western interior of Upoceax.

#### Climate Effect

The mountains act as a rain shadow, contributing to the desertification of the region to their north. They trap moisture on the southern side, leaving the northern Sand Reach desert parched and barren.

#### Terrain

The Sand Reach Mountains are an extensive system containing:
- Multiple distinct ranges and peaks
- Several states within the mountain territory
- Passes connecting the desert north to the forested south

#### Major Sub-Ranges

- **Drystone Mountains**: Central east-west range containing the state of Breia
- **Lyagnadarr Mountains**: Eastern range bordering Siquestrya, home to Svorinthak the dragon
- **Scarlet Peaks**: Southeastern mountains containing the fortress Viktryapos
- **Caffas Mountains**: Southern range home to rival force-user and fire-user tribes
- **Hills of Gezzeri**: Western hills inhabited by the water-starved Gezzerin who hide from giants in cliff dwellings
- **White Hills**: Home to the Thrygun orcs
- **Dnykuul**: Hilly region south of Breia, home to the Cendelle

### Breia

Tags: state, nation

A mountain state nestled within the Drystone Mountains, notable for its ancient ruins and dangerous magical sites. Breia occupies a series of interconnected valleys in the central Drystone range, protected from the worst desert winds by the surrounding peaks but still harsh and isolated.

#### Geography

Breia sits athwart the fire leyline that runs from Belu Jenari southward through the mountains. This leyline's presence has shaped the region's history—ancient civilizations built here to tap its power, and their ruins still dot the landscape. The terrain is rugged: steep mountain valleys, dry riverbeds that flash-flood during rare storms, and exposed ridgelines where nothing grows.

Water is scarce but not absent. Several seasonal streams flow through Breia's valleys, and the settlements cluster around reliable springs or wells. The fire leyline's influence keeps the region warmer than surrounding areas, which paradoxically makes survival harder—evaporation is relentless.

#### Capital: Iara

Iara is Breia's largest settlement and seat of governance, built in a sheltered valley in the eastern part of the state. The city developed around a cluster of hot springs heated by the fire leyline's proximity—providing year-round water and warmth that made permanent habitation possible.

The government of Breia operates from Iara, though "government" may be too strong a word. Breia is more a loose confederation of settlements that acknowledge Iara's leadership in matters of external trade and defense, while managing their own internal affairs.

#### Settlements

##### Jamtaland

A northern mountain town positioned at a key pass through the Drystone Mountains. Jamtaland serves as Breia's gateway to the northern desert, and most trade entering or leaving the state passes through its markets. The town is fortified—not against armies, but against the rocs and other flying predators that hunt the mountain passes.

##### Kopanes

A mining settlement in the western valleys, where Breian prospectors extract copper and tin from the mountain rock. The mines here are ancient—some shafts date back to whoever built Shtaneres—and occasionally break through into older workings with their own dangers. Kopanes is known for practical, hard people who don't ask too many questions about what their ancestors left behind.

##### Dalir

A central settlement positioned in the largest of Breia's interior valleys. Dalir is the agricultural heart of the state, such as it is—terraced gardens and hardy goat herds provide food for the other settlements. The valley's relative flatness makes it vulnerable to raids from the Dnykuul hills to the south.

##### Eyrar

A southwestern settlement near the edge of Breian territory, where the Drystone Mountains begin their descent toward the Giant Lands. Eyrar's people have the most contact with the giants and their vassals, trading mountain goods for lowland products. It's a rough town, accustomed to dealing with beings much larger than themselves.

#### Notable Locations

##### Shtaneres

The ruins of an ancient city in eastern Breia, built at the intersection of fire and air leylines. The city was destroyed long ago, its structures reduced to rubble by magical catastrophe. See the full entry in the Sandreach introduction for details on Hermelia's Lair.

##### Enki's House

A mysterious structure in the southwestern mountains, near Eyrar. Enki's House appears to be a single building of unusual architecture—curved walls, no visible doors at ground level, and windows placed too high for human use. Local legend holds it was built by a giant or titan named Enki who retreated here in ancient times.

The house is larger inside than outside. Explorers who have entered through the high windows report corridors that loop back on themselves, rooms that appear in different configurations on subsequent visits, and the persistent sense of being watched. Some claim to have heard breathing from behind the walls.

Whatever Enki was, if Enki ever existed, the house remains. Breians avoid it. The few treasure hunters who've gone in searching for giant artifacts have emerged empty-handed and shaken—or haven't emerged at all.

### Caffas Mountains

Tags: mountains

A mountain range in the southern portion of the Sandreach Mountains system, positioned between the Grognil Mountains to the west and the coastal lowlands to the east. The Caffas are notable for the elemental leylines that run through them—both fire and force leylines cross here, and the region's inhabitants have adapted to harness that power.

#### The Two Tribes

The Caffas Mountains are dominated by two major tribal confederations whose rivalry defines the region:

**The Flame Kindred** occupy the eastern Caffas, where the fire leyline runs strongest. Their settlements cluster around thermal vents and hot springs, and their warriors train in fire magic from childhood. The Flame Kindred are aggressive expansionists who believe the mountains rightfully belong to fire alone.

**The Ironbound** hold the western Caffas, drawing power from the force leyline. Their magic emphasizes durability, strength, and kinetic manipulation—they can shatter stone with a gesture or render themselves nearly immovable. The Ironbound are defensive by nature, content to hold their territory but utterly implacable when attacked.

The two tribes have warred intermittently for centuries. Neither can dislodge the other—fire magic struggles against force-hardened defenses, while the Ironbound lack the offensive power to push into Flame Kindred territory. The result is an uneasy stalemate punctuated by raids, skirmishes, and occasional pitched battles.

#### Settlements

The mountain settlements are divided between the two tribes, with a few neutral trading posts in the buffer zones.

##### Flame Kindred Settlements (Eastern)

- **Pellosyir** — Northeastern settlement, positioned to trade with coastal communities
- **Dvornuth** — Eastern coastal-facing town
- **Freynthiak** — Central-east settlement, known for its fire-speaker training grounds
- **Tüth** — Eastern settlement near the leyline's surface breach
- **Shaffiak** — Southeastern settlement overlooking the White Wastes
- **Benüd** — Northern settlement, closest to neutral territory
- **Eptriaki** — Central settlement, administrative center of the Flame Kindred

##### Ironbound Settlements (Western)

- **Bryzal** — Northwestern settlement near the Grognil Mountains
- **Pertheniak** — Western settlement, the Ironbound's largest and most fortified
- **Ilmin** — Central-west settlement
- **Choysinn** — Southern settlement near the Firefrost Hills

#### Geographic Features

##### Ptequin Lakes

A cluster of mountain lakes in the northern Caffas, fed by snowmelt and underground springs. The lakes mark the boundary between tribal territories and serve as neutral ground for the rare negotiations between Flame Kindred and Ironbound. Fishing rights are carefully allocated; violations have sparked wars.

##### The Leyline Crossing

Somewhere in the central Caffas, the fire and force leylines intersect. The exact location shifts over time and is known only to the most powerful magic users of both tribes. The crossing point is extraordinarily dangerous—combined elemental energies produce unpredictable effects. Both tribes consider it sacred and forbidden.

### Deadman's Lake

Tags: lake, geography

A large lake in the southwestern foothills where the Grognil Mountains descend toward the White Wastes. Deadman's Lake earned its name from the bodies—the water is cold, deep, and for reasons no one fully understands, corpses that enter the lake don't decompose. They sink to the bottom and stay there, preserved indefinitely.

#### The Depths

Fishermen who've worked Deadman's Lake describe seeing bodies on the bottom in clear water—some recent, some ancient, all perfectly preserved. There are hundreds, perhaps thousands. Some appear to be victims of violence; others look like they simply lay down and drowned. A few wear armor and clothing styles that haven't been seen in centuries.

No one knows why the lake preserves the dead. Some theorize it's connected to the proximity of the White Wastes and whatever curse affects that region. Others suggest the lake sits on a minor void or time leyline that arrests decay. The locals don't speculate—they fish the lake because the fish are plentiful, and they don't swim in it because they're not stupid.

#### Salt Tomb

On the western shore of Deadman's Lake stands the Salt Tomb—a burial structure made entirely of salt blocks, gleaming white against the dark water. The tomb predates any local memory; no one knows who built it or who (or what) is buried inside. The salt has not dissolved despite centuries of exposure to weather, which should be impossible.

The tomb is sealed. The few who've tried to break in have found the salt harder than stone, and the one expedition that tried tunneling underneath reported their tools corroding to rust within hours. Whatever's in the Salt Tomb, it's staying there.

### Dnykuul

Tags: hills, geography

A rugged hill country in the Sandreach Mountains, positioned between Breia to the north and the Scarlet Peaks to the east. The Dnykuul hills are dry, rocky, and largely barren—scrub vegetation, exposed stone, and seasonal streams that run dry for most of the year.

#### The Cendelle

The Dnykuul is home to the Cendelle—a reclusive people who've adapted to life in the harsh hill country. The Cendelle are not human, though their origins are unclear. They're shorter than humans, with pale skin that seems to absorb light rather than reflect it, and they see perfectly in darkness.

The Cendelle live in underground warrens carved into the hills, emerging at night to hunt, forage, and—occasionally—raid nearby settlements. They're not inherently hostile, but they're territorial and don't welcome outsiders. Travelers who pass through Dnykuul without causing trouble are usually left alone; those who linger or show too much interest in Cendelle territory tend to disappear.

Little is known about Cendelle society. They don't trade, don't negotiate, and kill anyone who enters their warrens uninvited. The few scholars who've studied them from a distance believe they worship something in the deep earth, but this is speculation.

#### Relationship with Neighbors

The settlements of Breia consider the Dnykuul a buffer zone—dangerous to cross, but useful for keeping threats from the south at bay. The Cendelle occasionally raid Dalir and other southern Breian towns, but the raids are more annoying than devastating. An understanding of sorts exists: Breia doesn't attempt to settle the Dnykuul, and the Cendelle don't push north in force.

The giants of Malo Kon Greikh to the west generally avoid the Dnykuul. The Cendelle are too small to be worth hunting and too vicious to be easily enslaved, and the hill country offers nothing the giants want.

### Drystone Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A major east-west mountain range within the Sandreach Mountains system, running through the central portion of the range. The Drystone Mountains mark the transition zone between the northern desert and the more temperate southern slopes.

The range takes its name from the pale, weathered stone that dominates its peaks—limestone and sandite formations that have been bleached by millennia of sun exposure. Rain is rare here, and when it comes, it runs off the bare rock in flash floods rather than soaking in. The "dry stone" looks almost white from a distance, giving the mountains an austere, skeletal appearance.

#### Fire Leyline

The Yolus fire leyline runs through the Drystone Mountains, passing from Belu Jenari in the north down through Breia and eventually into the southern territories. The leyline's influence keeps the mountains warmer than surrounding ranges and has attracted settlement and magical construction throughout history. The ruins of Shtaneres mark the most dramatic example of what happens when that power is misused.

#### Breia

The only organized state within the Drystone Mountains. Breia occupies the central valleys where the leyline's warmth and scattered water sources make permanent settlement possible. Its capital Iara sits atop hot springs heated by the leyline, and its people have adapted to life in a harsh landscape full of dangerous ruins. See the full Breia entry for details on its settlements and notable locations.

### Etsoia Lake

Tags: lake, geography

TODO

### Firefrost Hills

Tags: hills, geography

A transitional zone between the southern Caffas Mountains and the White Wastes, where the elevation drops from mountain heights to the flat expanse of the wastes below. The Firefrost Hills take their name from the bizarre weather patterns that occur here—hot air rising from the fire leyline collides with cold air sweeping north from Wycendeula, creating sudden temperature swings, unexpected frosts in summer, and heat waves in winter.

#### Climate

The Firefrost Hills are climatically unstable. A warm morning can turn to freezing by noon; snow can fall one day and melt under scorching sun the next. This unpredictability makes agriculture impossible and long-term habitation difficult. The few who live here are nomads who've learned to read the signs of incoming weather shifts.

#### The Border Zone

The hills mark the effective boundary between the Sandreach Mountains region and Wycendeula. The Flame Kindred of the Caffas consider the Firefrost Hills the southern edge of their territory, but they don't patrol it—the unstable weather and proximity to the orc and goblin tribes of the White Wastes make it more trouble than it's worth.

Travelers heading south into Wycendeula typically pass through the Firefrost Hills quickly, camping only when necessary and keeping watch for both weather changes and raiding parties from the wastes.

### Grognil Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A rugged mountain range in the southwestern Sandreach Mountains system, positioned between the Caffas Mountains to the east and the lowlands descending toward Wycendeula. The Grognil range is older and more weathered than its neighbors, with rounded peaks and deep valleys carved by ancient glaciers.

#### Character

The Grognil Mountains are utterly uninhabited. The force leyline that empowers the Ironbound runs through the eastern Grognil before continuing into Caffas territory, but the mountains themselves lack the thermal activity that makes the Caffas survivable. Winters are brutal, summers are short, and the few water sources freeze solid for most of the year.

The Ironbound occasionally send patrols into the eastern Grognil but never stay long. Something about the range resists settlement—expeditions report unshakeable unease, the sense of being watched from empty ridgelines. Whether this is residual leyline effects, territorial predators, or something older, the result is the same: no one lives here.

#### Liar's Lake

A high mountain lake in the northern Grognil, named for the dozens of expeditions that have claimed to find valuable resources nearby—and returned with nothing to show. The lake itself is unremarkable, but the surrounding peaks seem to confuse navigation. Parties split up and can't find each other. Cairns left as markers appear to move. The Ironbound avoid it entirely.

#### Larsoia Lake

A larger lake in the central Grognil, partially fed by underground springs that keep sections from freezing completely. The water is drinkable and the shores occasionally show signs of old camps, but no permanent settlement has ever taken hold. Travelers who stay more than a few nights report increasingly vivid dreams of drowning—not in water, but in absolute stillness, unable to move or cry out.

#### Etar's Lake

The highest of the Grognil lakes, accessible only through treacherous passes. Named for a hermit who supposedly lived on its shores for a century, though records suggest at least four different "Etars" over the centuries—none of whom aged, and all of whom vanished without explanation. The lake freezes solid for most of the year. Those who've camped here claim the ice sometimes shows shadows moving beneath it, even when nothing swims in the water.

### Hills of Gezzeri

### Lyagnadarr Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A rugged mountain range on the eastern edge of the Sandreach Mountains system, forming the northern and western boundary of Siquestrya. The peaks here are lower than the Drystone Mountains to the west but no less treacherous—the slopes are riddled with caves, unstable scree fields, and sudden drop-offs concealed by scrub vegetation.

The Lyagnadarr Mountains are home to the Lyndwyrmspren—lesser draconic creatures that hunt in packs across the mountain slopes. These creatures make the range dangerous for casual travelers but are not the primary threat.

#### Svorinthak's Domain

The dragon Svorinthak claims the central Lyagnadarr as her territory. Her presence casts a shadow over the entire range—the centaur tribes of Siquestrya give the mountains wide berth, and the Bazaar of Scales at the range's western edge operates only because Svorinthak permits it (or, more likely, finds it beneath her notice).

See the bestiary entry for Svorinthak for full details on this dragon.

### Scarlet Peaks

Tags: mountains, geography

A dramatic mountain range in the southeastern Sandreach Mountains, known for the distinctive red-orange coloration of its rock faces. The color comes from iron-rich stone that oxidizes in the dry mountain air, giving the peaks a bloody appearance at sunset that inspired their name.

#### Geography

The Scarlet Peaks rise sharply from the surrounding terrain, forming a barrier between the Drystone Mountains to the north and the coastal lowlands of Siquestrya to the southeast. The range is younger and more jagged than the weathered Drystone, with sheer cliff faces and narrow passes that make travel difficult.

The fire leyline passes through the western Scarlet Peaks before continuing south toward Wycendeula, and pockets of volcanic activity dot the range—hot springs, sulfur vents, and the occasional minor eruption. The iron in the stone may itself be a product of ancient volcanic activity.

#### Viktryapos

A tower carved into the red mountainside of the central Scarlet Peaks, rising from a high ridge with commanding views of the surrounding terrain. Viktryapos is a wizard's sanctum—home to a reclusive mage who chose this isolated location for the convergence of elemental energies where the fire leyline passes through iron-rich stone.

The tower's exterior is deceptively simple: a single spire of worked red rock that seems to grow from the mountain itself. Inside, the structure extends both upward and downward into the mountain, with laboratories, libraries, and chambers whose purposes visitors can only guess at. The wizard of Viktryapos is not hostile to travelers who approach respectfully, but neither is the tower a waystation—those seeking shelter or supplies are turned away, politely but firmly.

What draws a wizard to such an isolated place? The Scarlet Peaks offer something rare: the interaction between fire leyline energy and the iron deposits in the rock creates unique magical conditions. Spells cast here behave differently. Enchantments take hold more readily. And certain experiments that would be impossible elsewhere become merely dangerous.

The wizard's name and specific pursuits are not widely known. Those who've dealt with the tower's occupant describe someone old, patient, and utterly uninterested in the politics of the lowlands. The tower has stood for at least two centuries; whether the same wizard has occupied it the entire time is a matter of speculation.

#### Bettle Lake

A mountain lake in the northeastern Scarlet Peaks, one of the few permanent water sources in the range. Bettle Lake sits in a high valley accessible only through narrow passes, making it naturally defensible. A small community of herders lives near the lake, raising hardy mountain goats and trading wool and cheese with travelers.

The lake is unusually clear and cold, fed by underground springs rather than surface runoff. Local legend claims something lives in the depths—not hostile, but watchful. Herders report seeing large shapes moving beneath the surface on moonlit nights, though no one has ever been attacked.

### Triuci

Tags: region, giants

A hilly region in the northern Sandreach Mountains, home to hill giant clans known throughout the region for their aggression and brutality. The Triuci giants are smaller than their southern cousins in Malo Kon Greikh but make up for it with numbers, viciousness, and a complete lack of restraint.

#### The Triuci Giants

The hill giants of Triuci are considered primitive even by giant standards—emotionally stunted, quick to violence, and incapable of the sophisticated politics that characterize Malo Kon Greikh. They organize into loose clan structures held together by the biggest and meanest giant at any given time. Leadership changes frequently and violently.

A few years ago, a massive warband of Triuci giants swept south onto the Xeltri Plateau, demolishing the ogre city-states that had existed there for centuries. The giants showed no interest in occupying the territory—they simply destroyed everything, took what they wanted, and retreated back to their hills. The ruined ogre cities remain, picked over by scavengers but largely abandoned.

#### Relations

The Triuci giants raid neighboring territories constantly—the Hills of Gezzeri, the edges of Breia, and occasionally even into Malo Kon Greikh (though the larger giants there usually repel them). They don't trade, don't negotiate, and don't take prisoners except as food. Travelers give Triuci a wide berth.

## Giant Lands

### Geography

The Giant Lands occupy the central region of Upoceax—a hilly territory surrounded by mountains on multiple sides. As the name suggests, this is a land primarily inhabited by giants, who have made the rolling hills and valleys their home.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Sand Reach Mountains
- **East**: The Sand Reach Mountains continue along the eastern edge
- **South**: Wycendeula and its forests
- **West**: The Sand Reach Mountains and Kelder Mountains

#### Terrain

The Giant Lands are characterized by hilly terrain—not as dramatic as the surrounding mountain ranges, but elevated and varied. The landscape provides ample territory for the giant populations to hunt, settle, and maintain their way of life.

#### Inhabitants

The region is home to various giant populations, including the Güli mountain giants who inhabit the Gül Mountains. Most giants here are relatively peaceful, subsisting on hunting megafauna and large oxen.

### Malo Kon Greikh

Tags: state, nation, giants

The dominant giant nation in the southern Giant Lands, comprising a loose confederation of city-states along the Xcraya River Valley and surrounding highlands. Unlike the savage hill giants of Triuci, the giants of Malo Kon Greikh have built a civilization—crude by human standards, but sophisticated enough to maintain cities, conduct trade, and engage in politics beyond simple violence.

#### Geography

Malo Kon Greikh sprawls across the fertile Xcraya River Valley and the hills on either side. The Xcraya River provides water, transportation, and the agricultural base that supports the giant population. The northern border is loosely defined by the Xeltri Plateau; the eastern edge runs along the Gezzeri River where it marks the boundary with the Drystone Mountains.

#### Political Structure

Each city-state in Malo Kon Greikh is ruled by a chief or council, and each considers itself sovereign. The "nation" of Malo Kon Greikh is really a network of alliances, feuds, and trade relationships that shifts constantly. Wars between city-states are common but rarely genocidal—the giants understand that destroying rivals completely just creates opportunities for outsiders.

When external threats arise, the city-states can coordinate, but slowly and grudgingly. A true unified response requires a threat significant enough to make the chiefs set aside their rivalries—which hasn't happened in living memory.

#### The City-States

##### Morgrad

The largest and most politically significant of the giant city-states, positioned at the confluence of the Xcraya River and its major tributaries. Morgrad's chief claims precedence over the other cities—a claim most ignore, but which gives Morgrad outsized influence in regional politics.

##### Zord Oshbag

A northern city-state near the Xeltri Plateau border. Zord Oshbag's giants have taken to looting the ruined ogre cities, and the settlement has become a hub for trading recovered ogre artifacts.

##### Vrommol

An eastern city-state along the Gezzeri River, positioned to trade with (and raid) the settlements of Breia.

##### Kregkard

A prosperous city-state in the eastern valley, known for its metalworkers who produce giant-scale weapons and tools.

##### Kebuz Bakh

A southern city-state with access to lowland trade routes.

##### Zeror Gokh

A central city-state that serves as a neutral meeting ground for inter-city negotiations—when such negotiations occur.

##### Bragkur

A city-state in the central valley, frequently allied with Morgrad.

##### Vog Dridril

A southern city-state near the valley's end, trading with regions further south.

##### Xhodon

A western city-state in the upper valley, known for herding the massive cattle that form the base of giant diet.

##### Egzahd

A southwestern city-state in the hill country.

##### Khurgril

A western city-state near the Mathavia Mountains.

##### Ulbrizil

The westernmost city-state, positioned where the Xcraya River Valley meets the mountains.

#### Geographic Features

##### Xcraya River Valley

The fertile heart of Malo Kon Greikh, where the Xcraya River and its tributaries provide water for agriculture and transportation between city-states. The valley floor is cultivated with giant-scale crops—massive grain varieties, orchards of trees that would be forests elsewhere, and pastures for the enormous cattle the giants raise.

##### Gezzeri River

The eastern boundary of Malo Kon Greikh, flowing south from the Hills of Gezzeri through the borderlands between giant territory and the Drystone Mountains. The river marks a rough frontier—giants on the west, Breia and other human settlements on the east. Both sides raid across the river regularly.

##### Prisoner Hills

A region of rough hill country in the eastern part of Malo Kon Greikh, named for the tradition of keeping captives there. Giants who take prisoners in raids—whether for ransom, labor, or eventual consumption—hold them in camps scattered through these hills. Escape is theoretically possible but practically difficult; the terrain is disorienting, and escapees must cross giant territory to reach safety.

##### Xcraya Pallir

The broad floodplain where the Xcraya River spreads out before reaching the southern lowlands. This marshy, seasonally flooded region marks the southern extent of Malo Kon Greikh's effective control.

### Xeltri Plateau

Tags: plateau, giants, ogres, geography

A broad, elevated tableland in the northern Giant Lands, positioned between the Hills of Gezzeri to the north and Malo Kon Greikh to the south. The plateau was once home to a sophisticated ogre civilization—fortress cities built from the plateau's abundant stone, connected by paved roads and defended by disciplined ogre legions.

That civilization is gone. A few years ago, a massive warband of hill giants from Triuci swept across the plateau, demolishing everything in their path. The ogre city-states fell one by one, their inhabitants killed or scattered. The giants didn't stay to occupy—they simply destroyed and moved on, leaving the plateau a graveyard of shattered fortifications.

#### The Ruins

The ruined ogre cities are now picked over by scavengers, treasure hunters, and the occasional desperate refugee. The giants stripped obvious valuables, but ogre engineering hid many things in ways giants couldn't be bothered to find. The ruins are dangerous—unstable structures, lingering ogre traps, and creatures that have moved into the abandoned spaces.

##### Sypha Kestil

The northernmost of the ruined cities, positioned to watch the approaches from Triuci. Sypha Kestil's walls were the first to fall when the giants came. The ruins are relatively picked-over, having been accessible longest, but the city's underground granaries may still hold preserved supplies—and whatever was locked in the vaults beneath the citadel.

##### Drigard Gakh

A ruined city-state in the northern plateau, once a military stronghold. Its armories were legendary among the ogres.

##### Grug Rirmor

A ruined city-state in the central plateau. Grug Rirmor was the ogres' administrative center—if records of their civilization survive anywhere, they're buried here.

##### Urkrakr

A ruined city-state on the eastern plateau edge.

##### Cherruzil

A ruined city-state in the central-southern plateau, known for its temple complex dedicated to ogre ancestor spirits.

##### Zremmad Khag

The southernmost of the major ruins, positioned on the plateau's edge overlooking Malo Kon Greikh. The giants of Malo Kon Greikh have been known to send parties to loot Zremmad Khag, considering it within their sphere of influence.

#### Mina's House

A strange structure near Cherruzil that predates the ogre civilization—or at least, the ogres claimed it did. Mina's House is a squat stone building with no windows and a single door that opens onto a staircase descending into darkness. The ogres avoided it. Treasure hunters who've explored report that the stairs go down much farther than should be possible, and that something lives at the bottom.

The identity of "Mina" is unknown. The name comes from ogre records.

#### Ulle Alari

A settlement on the western edge of the plateau where it meets the Mathavia Mountains. Ulle Alari survived the giant invasion—barely—by virtue of its position in terrain too rough for the giants to bother with. The settlement is now home to ogre refugees, human scavengers, and others who make their living picking over the plateau's ruins. It's a rough, lawless place where questions about the past aren't welcome.

## Wycendeula

### Geography

Wycendeula encompasses the entire southern portion of Upoceax—a vast region stretching from the Eceraen Mountains in the far south (above Venalthier) northward to the Sand Reach Mountains. This is a land of colossal forests, frozen tundra, expansive plains, and scattered lakes.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Sand Reach Mountains and Giant Lands
- **East**: The Sea of Daggers and Frozen Sea; God's Bathtub separates Upoceax from Aboyinzu
- **South**: The Eceraen Mountains and Venalthier beyond
- **West**: The Farlands and Kelder Mountains

#### Major Features

##### Filvrae Sylvrym

The colossal forested region that dominates central Wycendeula—one of the largest continuous forests in Alaria. Home to the largest concentration of Ulvsjael (werewolves) on the continent.

##### Eyendra

The vast boreal forest of southeastern Wycendeula, stretching from the Eceraen Mountains northward to the Neurian Hills. Unlike Filvrae Sylvrym's wild vitality, Eyendra is haunted—the remnant of an ancient civilization called the Riin who merged with the land two thousand years ago. The forest remembers, and what it remembers makes it dangerous.

The only settlement in Eyendra is Zor, a city-state on Moornik Bay that survives through a pact with the ancient dragon Ezra Olkanis. The forest's interior, particularly the lake district called Kama Sa'malina, is forbidden territory.

##### The White Wastes

A desert region along the eastern coast, distinct from the tropical deserts elsewhere.

##### Plains of Wycendeula

Vast open plains stretching across the eastern portion of the region, roamed by satyr herds.

##### Eceraen Mountains

An east-west mountain range forming the southern boundary, separating Wycendeula from the frozen Venalthier.

#### Other Features

- **Kilbyurn and Srendar Mountains**: Frame portions of the vast plains
- **Lakes**: Tormluk, Trauma Lake, Mirror Lakes scattered throughout the plains; Kama Sa'malina (the "dreaming waters") in Eyendra's interior
- **Dragon Territories**: Ezra Olkanis claims the Eyendra forest; other dragons may hold territory in the western mountains

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Sea of Daggers / Frozen Sea**: Eastern waters
- **God's Bathtub**: The sea separating Upoceax from Aboyinzu to the northeast

Very sketchy, as it's located in the White Wastes which are filled with roaming goblin and orcish tribes.

### Balduahr

Tags: state, nation

The last dwarven kingdom in Wycendeula—a mountainous holdout wedged between the satyr-occupied plains to the east and the monster-haunted Kilbyurn range to the west. Balduahr's gray-stone dwarves have survived by being too difficult to conquer and too poor to bother with, though both conditions are changing.

#### Geography and Position

Balduahr occupies a section of the mountains where the Kilbyurns descend toward the plains. The kingdom controls three defensible valleys connected by tunnels and fortified passes. Beyond these valleys, the mountains become Kilbyurn territory proper—and the dwarves don't go there.

The Shivyll River originates in Balduahr's territory, providing water, power, and a transportation route. The river also provides the kingdom's greatest vulnerability: it flows east, directly into satyr lands.

#### The Cities

##### Graystone

The capital and oldest settlement, carved into a massive granite cliff face in the western valley. Graystone's architecture is defensive to the point of paranoia—the city has no ground-level entrances, only elevated gates accessible by retractable bridges.

The royal halls extend deep into the mountain, with the oldest chambers dating back millennia. The gray-stone dwarves take their name from the particular granite here, which has an unusual blue-gray tint. Mining continues in deep shafts below the city, though yields have declined over centuries.

Graystone's population is perhaps 8,000, down from historical peaks of 20,000 or more. The city can hold more, and the empty districts are maintained for a siege that hasn't come yet.

##### Ironforge

The industrial heart of the kingdom, positioned in the central valley where ore deposits are richest. Ironforge is built around a natural cavern system that provides ventilation for the foundries. The forges run continuously, producing weapons, tools, and trade goods.

Ironforge is more exposed than Graystone—the valley opens eastward, and the city's fortifications are less comprehensive. In the event of serious attack, the plan is evacuation to Graystone rather than defense in place.

The city specializes in practical metalwork rather than artisan pieces. Balduahr steel is serviceable but unremarkable; the kingdom lacks the exotic ores that produce legendary weapons. What they have is volume and reliability.

##### Plainwatch

The frontier outpost, built on a ridge where the mountains give way to the plains. Plainwatch is less a city than a fortified observation post with a permanent garrison. Its towers provide sight lines across dozens of miles of satyr territory.

Plainwatch exists to provide early warning. If the satyr ever unite—if the rumored king consolidates power—the signal fires from Plainwatch will give Graystone and Ironforge time to seal their defenses. The garrison rotates frequently; posting to Plainwatch is considered both honorable and deeply tedious.

The city has perhaps 2,000 permanent residents, mostly military families and support personnel. Civilian population fluctuates with threat assessment.

#### Strategic Concerns

Balduahr faces threats from multiple directions:

**The Satyr Question**: The plains hold perhaps a hundred thousand satyrs in scattered, disorganized camps. Individually or in small groups, they're manageable. United under a single leader, they would overwhelm Balduahr through sheer numbers. The kingdom's foreign policy consists largely of ensuring that unification never happens.

**The Kilbyurn Problem**: The western mountains are impassable, not because of terrain but because of what lives there. Granite wyrms, cloudwalkers, mountain drakes—the Kilbyurns are a bestiary of apex predators. Balduahr's western flank is secure only because nothing that enters the deep mountains survives. This also means the kingdom is trapped. There's no escape route west.

**Economic Decline**: The mines are depleting. Trade is difficult—the only viable routes run through satyr territory or across the dangerous White Wastes. Balduahr produces what it needs but has little surplus. The forges run on stockpiled ore that won't last forever.

#### Trade and Relations

Balduahr trades minimally with the outside world. Occasional caravans risk the northern route toward Caffas territory, exchanging metalwork for food and supplies. The journey is dangerous and the margins are thin.

Internal trade between the three cities is the economic backbone. Graystone provides governance and deep-mine ore; Ironforge provides finished goods; Plainwatch provides security. The system is self-sustaining but not prosperous.

Diplomatic contact with other nations is rare. Balduahr is too isolated and too poor to matter to continental politics. This is, in its way, a form of protection.

### Bay of Wolves

Tags: bay, coast, geography

A deep inlet cutting into the western coast of Wycendeula, framed by the Wolfmaw peninsula to the south and forested headlands to the north. The bay takes its name from the ulvsjael who dominate the surrounding forest—their howls carry across the water on still nights, audible to ships anchored miles offshore.

#### Geography

The Bay of Wolves stretches roughly 80 miles from its mouth to its innermost shore, with an average width of 40 miles. The northern shore curves gradually, densely forested down to the waterline. The southern shore is dominated by the Wolfmaw, a distinctive forked peninsula that gives the bay its protected character.

The water is cold year-round, fed by rivers draining the Fylvrae Sylvrym interior. Visibility is poor—silt from the forest floor washes down with every rain, staining the bay a murky green-brown. The bottom is soft mud and decomposing vegetation, unsuitable for anchoring in most areas.

Several rivers empty into the bay, the largest being the Twilight River at the bay's head. Smaller streams create marshy deltas along the northern shore, where the forest gives way to reed beds and tidal flats.

#### The Wolfmaw

The Wolfmaw is a peninsula extending roughly 30 miles into the bay, split at its tip into two rocky headlands that resemble open jaws—hence the name. The formation creates a natural breakwater, sheltering the inner bay from the worst ocean swells.

The peninsula's terrain is rougher than the mainland forest—rocky outcrops interrupt the tree cover, and the soil is thin enough that the canopy never fully closes. This relative openness makes the Wolfmaw marginally safer than the interior forest, though "safer" is relative. Ulvsjael packs use the peninsula as hunting ground, and the broken terrain provides excellent ambush positions.

The Wolfmaw's southern shore faces open ocean and catches the brunt of storms rolling in from the west. Shipwrecks dot the coastline, their timbers and cargo scattered across the rocks. Salvage is possible but risky—the noise of working a wreck attracts attention from the forest.

#### Octavus Marsh

Where the Twilight River meets the bay, the land flattens into a broad coastal marsh known as Octavus Marsh. The marsh extends several miles inland, a maze of channels, reed islands, and waterlogged forest.

The marsh is the closest thing to neutral ground in this region. The ulvsjael don't hunt here—the terrain is poor for their coordinated pack tactics, and the footing is treacherous even for wolves. This makes the marsh one of the few places where small parties might make landfall without immediate pursuit.

However, the marsh has its own dangers. The waters are home to large eels and aggressive snapping turtles. Quicksand-like patches of saturated peat can swallow the unwary. And while the ulvsjael don't hunt in the marsh, they do watch its edges. Emerging onto solid ground often means emerging into an ambush.

#### Maritime Activity

Despite the dangers, ships occasionally enter the Bay of Wolves. The reasons vary:

**Storm Shelter**: The bay offers excellent protection from western storms. Captains caught in heavy weather sometimes have no choice but to run for shelter, gambling that the ulvsjael won't swim out to investigate.

**Timber**: The Fylvrae Sylvrym produces exceptional hardwood—heartwood oak, ironbark, and other species valued for shipbuilding. Logging is suicidal, but driftwood and storm-felled trees wash down the rivers. A few enterprising (or desperate) crews anchor in the bay and collect whatever floats to them, departing before they attract attention.

**Skystone Hunters**: The buried skystones of Fylvrae Sylvrym are legendary. The bay provides the only practical access point for expeditions, and every few years someone mounts an attempt. The smart ones stay on their ships and wait for fortune to wash ashore. The others go inland. The ships usually wait a week before giving up and leaving.

**Accidental Arrival**: Storms, navigation errors, and pirates occasionally drive ships into the bay without intent. These crews have a simple choice: leave immediately, or become another wreck on the Wolfmaw shore.

#### Seasonal Patterns

The bay is navigable year-round, though winter brings ice formation in the shallower areas near river mouths. The main channel remains clear, fed by slightly warmer ocean currents.

Spring and autumn bring the heaviest rain, swelling the rivers and pushing silt into the bay. Visibility drops to nearly zero, and the water takes on the color of weak tea. This is when the most driftwood arrives—and when the marsh floods, extending the ulvsjael-free zone temporarily.

Summer is the calmest season, with light winds and clear skies. Paradoxically, this is the most dangerous time for ships—calm conditions mean the howling from the forest carries further, and ulvsjael activity peaks as the packs prepare for leaner seasons.

#### Landmarks

**The Jaws**: The twin headlands of the Wolfmaw, visible from far out to sea. Sailors use them as a navigation reference, though approaching too closely invites disaster.

**Driftwood Beach**: A stretch of the northern shore where currents concentrate floating debris. The closest thing to a reliable resource extraction point, though collecting requires time ashore.

**The Murk**: Local name for the innermost bay, where visibility drops to arm's length and the water is barely distinguishable from the marsh. Ships avoid it; anything that enters may not find its way out.

#### For Sailors

Treat the Bay of Wolves as a last resort. If you must enter:

- Anchor in deep water, well offshore. The mud bottom offers poor holding, so use multiple anchors.
- Do not go ashore after dark. Do not go ashore alone. Ideally, do not go ashore at all.
- If howling starts, prepare to leave immediately. The packs are aware of you.
- The Wolfmaw peninsula offers no real safety—its broken terrain just means you won't see them coming.
- Salvage operations should be conducted at speed. An hour ashore is reasonable. A day is pushing luck. Overnight is suicide.

The bay could be a valuable harbor if the forest weren't there. But the forest is there, and nothing changes that.

### Blue Shalewood

TODO

### Carcass Hills

Tags: hills, ruins, geography

A range of low, bleached hills rising from the southern Fylvrae Sylvrym, where the forest thins before meeting the Kilbyurn foothills. The hills take their name from what lies beneath them—and from their appearance at the right angle.

#### Geography

The Carcass Hills stretch roughly 40 miles east to west and 20 miles north to south, rising perhaps 500 feet above the surrounding forest floor at their highest point. The terrain is rolling rather than rugged, with gentle slopes and broad, flat-topped ridges.

The soil here is thin and alkalite, supporting only sparse grass and scrub brush. The underlying stone is a pale limestone shot through with ancient fossite deposits—the compressed remains of creatures from an era before recorded history. Rain and wind have carved the exposed rock into strange shapes: arches, pillars, and formations that resemble skeletal remains at the right angle.

Several rivers drain through the hills, their channels cutting shallow valleys between the ridges. The Voules River is the largest, flowing south toward the Eceraen foothills. The water runs clear here, filtered through the limestone, though it carries a slightly mineral taste.

#### Why "Carcass" Hills

The name has three sources, and all are accurate:

**The Appearance**: The pale limestone formations, eroded by wind and rain, resemble nothing so much as enormous ribcages and spines protruding from the earth. From certain angles, the whole range looks like a graveyard of titans—or the picked-clean remains of something even larger.

**The Fossils**: The rock is dense with fossilized remains. Bones of unfamiliar creatures protrude from cliffsides and erode out of hillsides after heavy rains. Some are recognizable—giant elk, massive bears, creatures that still exist in smaller forms. Others are not. Collectors prize the fossils, though reaching them requires passing through ulvsjael territory.

**The Dead**: Something terrible happened here, long ago. The hills are layered with mass graves—not natural accumulations, but deliberate burials. Whoever they were, they numbered in the tens of thousands. The bones are human, or close to it, and they've been there for millennia.

#### The Ulvsjael and the Hills

Unusually, the Carcass Hills are not prime ulvsjael territory. The packs hunt here occasionally, but no pack claims the hills as core territory. The terrain is poor for their tactics—too open, too exposed, with inadequate cover for coordinated ambushes.

This makes the Carcass Hills one of the few places in western Wycendeula where careful travelers might pass without immediate confrontation. The operative word is "might." Packs still patrol the surrounding forest, and the hills offer no protection once you're noticed. But the hills themselves are as close to neutral ground as exists in this region.

Local satyr have a different theory about why the ulvsjael avoid the hills. They claim the place is cursed—that the spirits of whoever died here still linger, and that the wolves can sense them. The ulvsjael, predictably, don't explain their behavior.

#### The Citadel

At the heart of the Carcass Hills stands the ruin of an ancient city-state, known simply as The Citadel. The original name—if it had one—has been lost.

The Citadel was built on and into the largest hill, its walls and towers constructed from the same white limestone as the surrounding terrain. From a distance, the ruins blend into the hillside; only on approach do the worked stones become distinguishable from natural formations.

The city was substantial. Outer walls enclose perhaps two square miles; interior structures suggest a population of 20,000 or more at its height. The architecture is unfamiliar—geometric, angular, with an emphasis on vertical structures that seems designed for beings who could fly or didn't mind climbing. Windows are placed too high for convenient access. Doorways are narrow. Staircases spiral upward with steps uncomfortably tall for human legs.

The Citadel has been abandoned for at least 3,000 years, possibly much longer. The walls still stand in many sections, testament to the quality of the original construction, but roofs have collapsed and interior chambers have filled with debris. What remains above ground has been picked clean by centuries of cautious treasure seekers.

##### Below Ground

The surface structures are the least interesting part of The Citadel. The city extends downward into the limestone, with passages and chambers carved deep into the hill. The upper levels have been explored—barracks, storerooms, cisterns, the expected infrastructure of any fortified city. Below that, exploration becomes dangerous and maps become unreliable.

The deep levels contain architecture that doesn't match the surface city. The geometric precision gives way to organic curves; corridors narrow and branch unpredictably; chambers open onto vertical shafts of unknown depth. Some explorers report finding carvings that depicted scenes of worship or sacrifice. Others report nothing but empty stone.

What everyone reports is the feeling of being watched. The deep Citadel doesn't want visitors.

##### The Mass Graves

The correlation between The Citadel and the mass graves in the surrounding hills is obvious but unexplained. Were these the city's inhabitants, killed in some catastrophe? Enemies, slain in a great battle? Sacrifices, offered to whatever the city's rulers worshipped?

The bones offer few clues. They're too old for any remaining tissue, too jumbled for determining cause of death. They were buried deliberately—in some cases arranged in patterns—but the patterns' meaning is lost.

One popular theory holds that The Citadel was a center for some form of necromancy, and that the dead in the hills were raised to serve as laborers or soldiers. The steep, narrow architecture would make sense for a population of undead servitors who didn't need comfortable access. The mass graves would be the storage areas, waiting for reanimation.

This theory has no evidence beyond architectural speculation. But no better theory exists.

#### Current State

The Citadel is empty but not safe.

The surface ruins attract occasional explorers, scholars, and treasure hunters who are willing to risk ulvsjael territory for a chance at ancient artifacts. Most find little of value—the easy pickings were taken centuries ago. Some find passage to the lower levels and don't return.

The ulvsjael packs avoid The Citadel itself even more thoroughly than they avoid the surrounding hills. They don't enter the ruins, don't hunt on the central hill, and become visibly agitated if pursued toward it. Whatever keeps them from the Carcass Hills generally keeps them from The Citadel absolutely.

This makes The Citadel a potential refuge for those fleeing through the forest—if you can reach it. The surrounding hills still require crossing ulvsjael patrol routes. But once inside the ruins, the wolves won't follow.

Why they won't follow is another question no one can answer.

#### For Explorers

The Carcass Hills offer the best passage route through southern Fylvrae Sylvrym. Stay on the ridgelines where visibility is good. Move during daylight when the pale stone makes approaching threats visible. The Citadel provides emergency shelter if needed.

Don't descend into the lower levels without significant preparation. The upper ruins are safe enough—abandoned and picked clean. Below the second subterranean level, the architecture changes and the sense of wrongness intensifies. Several well-equipped expeditions have gone deeper. None have returned intact.

The fossils embedded in the limestone might be valuable, but extracting them takes time you may not have. Better to note locations and return with proper support than to spend an hour chipping at rock while wolves circle.

### The Cobbled Coast

Tags: coast, geography

A rugged peninsula on Wycendeula's southeastern shore, where the Plains of Wycendeula meet God's Bathtub. The coastline earned its name from the distinctive stone-strewn beaches—not natural formations, but the debris of countless wrecked ships accumulated over millennia.

#### Geography

The Cobbled Coast juts eastward into God's Bathtub, creating a navigation hazard for ships traveling the eastern sea routes. The peninsula's terrain is rough—rocky outcrops, steep cliffs, and sparse vegetation. Inland, the Hills of Sharp Talons rise in jagged formation; seaward, the coastline offers few safe anchorages.

The beaches are the peninsula's most distinctive feature. Centuries of shipwrecks have deposited wood, metal, and cargo across the shores. Storms periodically churn the debris, revealing new artifacts while burying others. The effect is a jumbled pavement of ship timbers, anchor chains, hull fragments, and unidentifiable wreckage.

#### The Wreck Legacy

Why so many ships have foundered here is debated. The obvious factors—treacherous currents, underwater rocks, sudden storms—account for many losses. But sailors who've survived the passage report other hazards:

**The Calling Rocks**: Certain stone formations along the coast produce sounds when wind passes through them—whistles, moans, and occasionally what sounds like voices. Some navigators claim the sounds have lured ships toward the rocks. Others dismiss this as superstition masking poor seamanship.

**Unpredictable Currents**: The waters around the Cobbled Coast behave strangely, possibly influenced by the force leyline that passes nearby before reaching the Pugrai lakes. Currents reverse without warning; ships find themselves pushed toward shore despite favorable winds.

**The Harpy Colonies**: The Hills of Sharp Talons are home to aggressive harpy populations that have learned to prey on distressed vessels. When storms drive ships close to shore, the harpies swarm.

In ancient times, before the satyr conquest, the coast was apparently well-charted and navigable. The current hazards may have developed since—or the knowledge of how to avoid them may simply have been lost.

#### The Hills of Sharp Talons

A low mountain range running along the peninsula's spine, named for the distinctive limestone formations that crown its peaks—spires and blades of pale stone that resemble enormous talons clutching at the sky.

The formations are natural, carved by wind and rain over eons, but they create perfect nesting habitat for the peninsula's apex predators.

**Harpy Territories**: Multiple harpy colonies occupy the hills, each claiming a section of the ridge. The colonies are mutually hostile but unite against external threats. Their hunting range extends miles in every direction, covering the coast and extending over the water.

The harpies have adapted to coastal life. They dive for fish, scavenge shipwrecks, and attack anything that ventures onto the peninsula without adequate defense. They're intelligent enough to recognize armed groups and generally avoid direct confrontation—but they're patient, and they watch for vulnerability.

**Stone Nests**: The harpies build their nests in the talon formations themselves, wedging materials into crevices and hollows in the limestone. From a distance, the hills appear uninhabited; only closer inspection reveals the colonies. The nests often contain salvage from shipwrecks—metal, glass, anything shiny.

**The Talon Shrine**: Deep in the hills, where the largest formations cluster, there's evidence of pre-satyr construction—cut stone foundations, carved pillars, and what might be an altar. The harpies nest around it but don't seem to use it. Scholars speculate this was a sacred site for the humans who once occupied Wycendeula, possibly connected to wind worship or the sky.

#### Crossing the Peninsula

Overland travel across the Cobbled Coast is possible but dangerous. The terrain is difficult, water sources are scarce, and the harpies are ever-present. Most who attempt it travel in armed groups, moving at night when the harpies are less active.

The peninsula sees occasional traffic despite the hazards. Treasure hunters come seeking shipwreck salvage; the accumulated debris represents centuries of cargo. Scholars come to study the ancient ruins. A few hardy souls attempt to harvest harpy feathers, which command premium prices for certain magical applications.

None of these visitors stay long. The Cobbled Coast tolerates intrusion poorly.

#### Connection to Ancient Wycendeula

The peninsula shows more evidence of pre-satyr habitation than most of the plains. Besides the Talon Shrine, there are foundation stones along the coast that suggest a harbor or watchtower, and the beach debris occasionally yields artifacts far older than the shipwrecks—worked stone, corroded bronze, fragments of pottery with unfamiliar designs.

Whatever civilization once thrived here, they built on the Cobbled Coast. Whether they fell to the same forces that ended human occupation of the plains, or abandoned the peninsula earlier, remains unknown.

### Deadman's Lake

Tags: lake, geography, poi

A cold mountain lake nestled in the northern Kilbyurn foothills, where the forest begins to thin and the terrain rises toward the high peaks. The lake's waters are clear and deep, fed by snowmelt and underground springs, with a surface that reflects the surrounding mountains with mirror-like clarity.

The name comes from what floats in it.

#### Geography

Deadman's Lake occupies a natural bowl carved by ancient glaciers, roughly three miles long and a mile wide at its broadest point. The water is exceptionally deep—over 400 feet in the central basin—and cold enough to numb exposed skin within minutes. The lakebed drops steeply from the shore, offering no shallow wading areas.

The surrounding terrain is transition zone between forest and mountain. The western shore is forested, though the trees are smaller and more widely spaced than in the lowland Fylvrae Sylvrym. The eastern shore rises into bare rock and scree slopes, climbing toward the Kilbyurn peaks. Several small streams feed the lake from the mountains; a single outlet flows west toward the forest interior.

The lake has no fish. The water is too cold, too deep, and something about its mineral content discourages aquatic life. Birds occasionally land on the surface but don't linger. The stillness is pronounced.

#### The Dead

Bodies surface in Deadman's Lake with disturbing regularity.

Some are recent—travelers who fell through ice, climbers who slipped from the surrounding cliffs, victims of ulvsjael attacks who crawled to the water before dying. These are easily explained. The lake is remote and dangerous; people die here.

But other bodies are old. Very old. Preserved by the cold water, they drift up from the depths in states of remarkable preservation—skin intact, features recognizable, clothing from centuries past. Some wear armor styles that haven't been forged in a thousand years. Some have wounds that suggest violence. Some show no cause of death at all.

The lake seems to collect the dead. Locals claim that bodies from miles around somehow find their way to the water—that streams carry them, or that the dying are drawn here by some compulsion, or that the lake simply takes what it wants. None of these explanations are satisfying. All of them might be true.

#### The Salt Tomb

On the lake's eastern shore, where the rocks rise sheer from the water, a cave mouth opens into the mountainside. The entrance is marked by white mineral deposits that give the appearance of salt encrustation—hence the name. Inside, the cave extends deep into the mountain, its walls lined with the same crystalline residue.

The Salt Tomb is not a natural formation. The cave was carved, widened, and reinforced in a style that predates any known civilization in this region. The walls bear carvings that have been obscured by centuries of mineral buildup but are clearly deliberate. The passage descends at a gentle angle, spiraling into the mountain.

What lies at the bottom is unknown. Every expedition that has gone deep has either returned empty-handed—claiming the passage became impassable—or not returned at all. The survivors describe increasing disorientation as they descended, difficulty breathing despite adequate airflow, and the persistent feeling that something was following them back up.

The Salt Tomb's relationship to the lake is unclear. The cave doesn't connect to the water at any mapped point, but the mineral deposits suggest they share a source. Some scholars theorize that the tomb was built as a repository—a place to store something that needed to remain cold, isolated, and watched. Others think it was a prison.

The ulvsjael don't enter the Salt Tomb. They don't go near Deadman's Lake at all. This is the only place in the northern forest where their absence is guaranteed. Whatever they sense here, they want no part of it.

#### For Travelers

Deadman's Lake offers one of the few reliable safe zones in the northern Fylvrae Sylvrym. The ulvsjael avoid the area entirely, creating a bubble of relative safety perhaps five miles in diameter centered on the lake.

The operative word is "relative." The lake itself is dangerous—the cold water, the sheer drop-offs, the unsettling presence of preserved corpses. The Salt Tomb is worse. And while the ulvsjael don't come here, other predators do. The mountain slopes host their own dangers, and the forest edge isn't truly safe just because the wolves avoid it.

Still, for those fleeing through ulvsjael territory, the lake represents a chance to rest. The western shore offers camping sites with clear sight lines. Water is plentiful, though drinking from a lake full of corpses takes some adjustment. The outlet stream is safer—the water has been filtered through several miles of rocky terrain by the time it's drinkable.

Do not enter the Salt Tomb without significant preparation and the expectation that you may not return. Do not swim in the lake. Do not investigate the bodies—they've been dead long enough that disturbing them serves no purpose, and some of them... move in the current more than they should.

### Eberri Ygonzi

Tags: forest, geography, dangerous, monsters, wycendeula

The great forest of southwestern Wycendeula—a dense expanse of ancient conifers and tangled undergrowth stretching from the Neurian Hills to the edge of Kama Sa'malina. Where Eyendra in the northeast is haunted by old magic, Eberri Ygonzi is simply, brutally wild. This is old growth that has never been logged, never been settled, never been tamed. The things that live here have had thousands of years to become very good at killing.

The name is archaic—no one remembers what language it comes from or what it originally meant. Locals sometimes call it the Ygonzi or just "the deep forest." Whatever you call it, the message is the same: don't go in.

#### Geography

Eberri Ygonzi covers roughly eight thousand square miles of dense boreal forest, bounded by the Neurian Hills to the northwest, the Endari Hills to the northeast, and Kama Sa'malina's lake country to the southeast. The southern edge fades into scrubland as the terrain rises toward the East Whitewall mountains and the Pale Death beyond.

The forest floor is a maze of fallen timber, thick undergrowth, and terrain that defeats easy movement. Ravines cut through unexpectedly. Streams appear and vanish. The canopy blocks enough light that navigation by sun is unreliable. People who enter without experience get lost within hours. People who enter with experience still get lost—they're just better at surviving it.

The interior contains The Nox—a region of hills where the forest grows differently and worse things live. Locals treat The Nox as a separate place entirely, though no clear boundary marks where Eberri Ygonzi ends and The Nox begins.

#### What Lives Here

**Coilwights**

The forest's signature horror. Coilwights are serpentine predators fifteen to thirty feet long, as thick as a man's thigh, covered in scales that shift color to match their surroundings. They hunt from the trees, dropping onto prey from above, and they kill through constriction—but not the way normal constrictors do.

A coilwight doesn't just squeeze. It *inverts*. The pressure it applies forces the victim's body to compress in ways anatomy doesn't support. Bones break inward. Organs rupture. The process takes minutes and the victim is conscious for most of it. Coilwights seem to prefer this—they'll release prey that dies too quickly and find something else.

Worse: coilwights collect skins. Not to wear, but to... line things with. Their lairs are hollows draped in preserved hides, arranged in patterns that suggest purpose without revealing what that purpose is. Scholars who've studied coilwight lairs (from a safe distance, after the occupant was confirmed dead) report that the skin arrangements seem deliberate, even ritualistic. No one knows why. No one wants to know badly enough to study them closer.

Coilwights are solitary and territorial. This is the only reason Eberri Ygonzi is survivable—if they cooperated like gilthrain, nothing would leave the forest alive.

**Thornbacks**

Boar-like creatures the size of horses, covered in quills that they can launch with surprising accuracy. Thornbacks are aggressive, territorial, and ill-tempered even by the standards of animals that will charge anything that moves. They're also one of the few things in Eberri Ygonzi that coilwights avoid—the quills make them difficult to constrict, and thornbacks travel in groups.

Ironically, thornbacks are the closest thing the forest has to safe company. If you can track a thornback herd without getting close enough to provoke them, you know coilwights aren't nearby. Experienced hunters use this, following at a distance and trusting the thornbacks to clear the path.

**Other Threats**

- **Drop-spiders**: Fist-sized arachnids that nest in the canopy and drop weighted silk lines onto prey below. The silk is adhesive and strong enough that a full coating can immobilize a grown man. The spiders themselves aren't venomous—they don't need to be. They just wait until the prey exhausts itself.
- **Corpse-lilies**: Plants that smell exactly like rotting meat to attract scavengers, then release spores that cause hallucinations and disorientation. Not directly lethal, but being lost and hallucinating in coilwight territory amounts to the same thing.
- **The usual predators**: Wolves, bears, great cats—all present, all larger and more aggressive than their counterparts elsewhere. The forest selects for size and violence.

#### The Nox

The hills at Eberri Ygonzi's center, where the forest changes character and the dangers multiply. See the separate entry for The Nox—it warrants its own documentation.

The boundary between Eberri Ygonzi proper and The Nox isn't marked, but experienced woodsmen claim they can feel when they've crossed it. The light dims. The sounds change. The forest, already hostile, becomes actively malevolent.

#### No Settlements

Eberri Ygonzi has never supported permanent habitation. Several attempts have been made over the centuries—logging camps, hunting lodges, even a small fortress meant to project power into the interior. All failed. The camps were abandoned after unacceptable losses. The fortress lasted three years before the garrison walked out and refused to return, offering no explanation beyond "we can't stay there."

The forest edge supports seasonal activity. Hunters work the perimeter when pelts are valuable enough to justify the risk. Herbalists gather plants found nowhere else. But everyone leaves before nightfall, and no one goes deep.

#### Travel Through Eberri Ygonzi

Sometimes unavoidable. The forest lies between the Neurian Hills and Kama Sa'malina, and certain routes through Wycendeula require crossing one or the other. Given the choice, most people prefer the forest. At least coilwights can be avoided with care; gilthrain colonies cannot.

Survival guidelines:

- **Move during dawn and dusk**: Coilwights are most active at night and midday. The shoulder hours offer better odds.
- **Watch the canopy**: Coilwights attack from above. If you can't see clear sky through the branches, assume something is watching you.
- **Follow water**: Streams create breaks in the canopy and coilwights avoid getting wet. River routes are safer, though not safe.
- **Make noise**: Counter-intuitive, but silence draws attention. Steady noise—talking, singing, anything consistent—tells the forest's predators that you're alert. They prefer unaware prey.
- **Avoid The Nox**: There is no reason to enter The Nox. If your route would take you through, find another route.
- **Don't camp alone**: Take watches. Sleep in trees if possible. Never, ever sleep on the forest floor.

#### Hooks

- **The abandoned fortress**: Grymhold, the fortress that was abandoned without explanation, still stands in the eastern Ygonzi. Treasure hunters occasionally brave the journey to loot it. Most don't return. Those who do report that the fortress isn't empty—something lives there now, something that isn't wildlife. What happened to the garrison, and what's claimed their stronghold?

- **Coilwight behavior is changing**: A hunter reports that a coilwight approached her without attacking, watched her for several minutes, and then withdrew. This is unprecedented—coilwights don't observe, they kill. Something has changed, and the implications are unclear.

- **The herbalist's map**: A dying herbalist offers a map to a grove deep in Eberri Ygonzi where a plant grows that can cure a specific rare disease. The map is genuine. The grove exists. Getting there and back is the problem.

- **Thornback stampede**: Something spooked a thornback herd badly enough to drive them out of the forest entirely—they've been rampaging through farmland for days. Whatever scared them is presumably still in the forest. The locals want the stampede stopped, but the larger question is what could frighten thornbacks badly enough to make them flee.

### Eceraen Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, border

A rugged east-west mountain range forming the southern boundary of Wycendeula, separating the forested lowlands from the frozen wastes of Venalthier beyond. The Eceraen range stretches hundreds of miles from the western coast to the Kilbyurn junction, creating an effective barrier between the two regions.

#### Geography

The Eceraen Mountains rise abruptly from the southern edge of Fylvrae Sylvrym, climbing from forested foothills to snow-capped peaks within twenty miles. The highest summits reach perhaps 14,000 feet, perpetually glaciated and frequently obscured by cloud.

The range is relatively young geologically, with sharp peaks and deep valleys rather than the rounded forms of older mountains. Cliff faces are common; exposed rock is dark volcanic basalt shot through with lighter granite intrusions. The terrain is rugged throughout, offering few easy passages.

The northern slopes—facing Wycendeula—receive less precipitation than the southern face and support patchy forest up to about 8,000 feet elevation. Above the treeline, alpine meadows give way to bare rock and permanent snowfields. The southern slopes are substantially harsher, catching the full force of cold winds from Venalthier.

#### As a Barrier

The Eceraen Mountains effectively seal southern Wycendeula from the frozen continent beyond. This is both geographic and practical:

**Geographic**: No passes cross the range at useful elevations. The lowest points are still above 9,000 feet, choked with snow for most of the year and requiring technical climbing even in summer. The range is simply impassable for caravans, armies, or casual travelers.

**Practical**: Even if passages existed, Venalthier offers nothing worth reaching. The frozen wastes beyond the mountains are lifeless tundra extending to the polar ice cap. No civilization exists there; no resources justify the crossing. The mountains don't guard anything—they simply mark the edge of habitable land.

This makes the Eceraen range more a boundary than a barrier in the strategic sense. No one defends it because no one attacks from the south. The mountains simply are, and everything beyond them is nothing.

#### Wildlife and Hazards

The Eceraen foothills support similar wildlife to the Fylvrae Sylvrym lowlands, though the forest thins quickly with elevation. Above the treeline, the fauna shifts to alpine specialists: mountain goats, marmots, raptors. Large predators are present but less common than in the lowland forest—the ulvsjael don't climb this high, and the terrain doesn't support pack hunting.

The mountains themselves pose the primary hazards:

**Avalanches** are common on the steeper slopes, particularly in spring when accumulated snow becomes unstable. The dark rock absorbs heat unevenly, creating fracture points in the snowpack.

**Rockfall** occurs regularly along cliff faces, where freeze-thaw cycles loosen stone. The sound can echo for miles, sometimes triggering additional slides.

**Weather** changes rapidly at elevation. Clear mornings become whiteout blizzards within hours. Summer temperatures that allow comfortable hiking can drop below freezing by nightfall.

**Navigation** is difficult above the treeline, where landmarks become obscured by snow and distance. The mountains look similar from peak to peak; disorientation is common even for experienced climbers.

#### Azkirk

In the western Eceraen foothills, where the mountains meet the coast, stands a lone marker that appears on some maps as Azkirk. The name is old—possibly pre-satyr—and its meaning is lost.

What Azkirk marks is unclear. Some maps show it as a settlement, others as a point of interest, still others as a warning. The location corresponds to a rocky headland where the mountain slopes plunge directly into the sea, creating a natural landmark visible from ships offshore.

Those who've investigated report finding nothing but stone—no structures, no artifacts, no obvious significance. Yet the name persists across centuries of cartography, copied from map to map by scribes who know only that something important once happened there, or will happen, or is happening still.

Local satyr avoid the area, claiming the ground is "marked." They don't explain what this means. The ulvsjael don't come this far south regardless. Whatever Azkirk represents, it remains a minor mystery in a region full of greater ones.

#### For Travelers

The Eceraen Mountains are not a destination. They mark the southern limit of habitable Wycendeula. Travel into the range is possible for experienced mountaineers with proper equipment, but there's nothing to find beyond challenge and scenery.

The foothills offer easier terrain than the forest lowlands. The ulvsjael hunt here less frequently, and the rocky ground provides better defensive positions. Following the mountain base is a viable route for those traveling east-west through southern Wycendeula—slower than direct passage but significantly safer.

Don't attempt to cross the range. Whatever lies beyond isn't worth dying to reach.

### Endari Hills

Tags: hills, geography, wycendeula

The transitional highlands between the forests and the lakes—a band of rolling terrain separating Eberri Ygonzi from the northern reaches of Kama Sa'malina. The Endari Hills are neither as deadly as the forest nor as treacherous as the lake country, but they're hardly safe. This is buffer zone, and everything that survives here has learned to avoid the worse things on either side.

#### Geography

The Endari Hills stretch roughly sixty miles east to west and thirty miles north to south, rising gradually from the forest floor and dropping into the marshy lowlands around the lakes. The terrain is open compared to Eberri Ygonzi—scrub forest, rock outcrops, grassy slopes with occasional stands of wind-bent conifers.

The hills offer the best overland travel route in the region. Moving east-west through Wycendeula's southern reaches, travelers can either cross Eberri Ygonzi (coilwights), Kama Sa'malina (gilthrain), or the Endari Hills (relatively nothing). Most choose the hills.

This makes the Endari the closest thing the region has to a trade route, though "trade route" implies more traffic than actually exists. A handful of trappers, hunters, and desperate travelers cross the hills each year. It's enough to maintain rough paths but not enough to support permanent way-stations.

#### What's Here

**Wildlife**

The hills support the kind of fauna you'd expect—deer, rabbits, ground-nesting birds, the predators that hunt them. Wolves and foxes range across the Endari, as do occasional bears. Nothing dramatically dangerous by the standards of wilderness elsewhere.

The notable absence: nothing from Eberri Ygonzi or Kama Sa'malina. Coilwights don't leave the forest cover. Gilthrain can't survive far from water. The Pallid stick to the Pale Death and its immediate approaches. The Endari Hills exist in a gap between territories, too exposed for forest hunters and too dry for lake predators.

**Bristle-wolf packs** sometimes range into the hills from Eberri Ygonzi, hunting in the open terrain. They're the main non-environmental threat travelers face—smart enough to avoid large groups, patient enough to follow smaller ones for days.

**The Burned Stones**

A circle of blackite monoliths on the highest hill in the range, clearly artificial, origin unknown. The stones stand twelve to fifteen feet tall, arranged in a ring roughly a hundred feet across. Their surfaces are smooth, almost glassy, as if subjected to intense heat.

No one knows who built the Burned Stones or why. The arrangement doesn't match any known culture's practices. The stones predate the Riin, predate human presence in Wycendeula, possibly predate the Third Eon. Scholars have examined them without learning anything useful—the stones are just stones, apparently, carrying no magical signature or planar resonance.

Local trappers avoid the circle anyway. The stones feel wrong, they say. Not dangerous, just... observed. Standing in the ring produces the sensation of being watched by something very far away.

#### Travel Advice

The Endari Hills are the safest route through the region, but "safest" is relative.

- **Stick to the ridgelines**: The high ground offers visibility and keeps you away from the forest edge (where coilwights hunt) and the lake approaches (where gilthrain territory begins).
- **Travel in daylight**: The hills don't have nocturnal super-predators, but bristle-wolves prefer to attack at night.
- **Avoid the Burned Stones at night**: Probably superstition. But the trappers who use these hills regularly all say the same thing, and they've survived longer than the people who dismissed their advice.
- **Watch for weather**: The hills are exposed. Storms that would be merely unpleasant in the forest become dangerous in open terrain.

#### Hooks

- **Something's changed at the Burned Stones.** A trapper reports that the monoliths have moved—not much, maybe a few feet each, but they're now facing inward when they used to face outward. No one has seen them move. No one can explain how stones weighing tons could shift without leaving marks. But someone's paying to investigate.

- **Bristle-wolves are massing.** Multiple packs have been seen traveling together through the Endari Hills—unprecedented behavior for a territorial species. Something is either driving them from Eberri Ygonzi or drawing them toward Kama Sa'malina. Either way, the hills are becoming more dangerous, and the reason matters.

- **The safe route isn't.** Travelers have gone missing in the Endari Hills—not in the forest, not in the lakes, but in the theoretically safe buffer zone. No bodies have been found. No signs of predator attack. People are simply vanishing, and the survivors are too few to provide useful information.

### Eyendra

Tags: forest, geography, riin, dangerous

The Eyendra is one of Alaria's great forests—a vast expanse of boreal woodland stretching across southeastern Wycendeula, from the Eceraen Mountains in the south to the Neurian Hills in the northwest, bounded by the coast and Moornik Bay to the east. At over 200 miles north to south and 300 miles east to west, it rivals the Filvrae Sylvrym in scale, though the two forests could not be more different in character.

Where Filvrae Sylvrym is wild but living, Eyendra is something else. The forest is *inhabited*—not by people, but by what people became. And that presence makes it dangerous.

#### Geography

Eyendra occupies the southeastern corner of Wycendeula, covering roughly 50,000 square miles of dense boreal forest. The terrain is shaped by glacial history—rolling hills, countless small lakes, and soil that holds water poorly, creating bogs and marshland throughout.

**Key features:**
- **Lean D'Riin**: The central forest, the oldest and most dangerous section
- **Lean D'Kas**: The northwestern forest, slightly less treacherous
- **Wer Azenzi**: The lake district where Riin presence pools most densely
- **The Lygrone Valley**: The river corridor showing the densest ancient ruins
- **Moornik Bay**: The eastern coast where Zor stands as the sole settlement

The forest grows denser and older as one moves inland. The coastal fringe—a day's travel at most—is navigable boreal woodland. Beyond that, the canopy thickens until light barely reaches the forest floor. The deepest interior has never been properly mapped.

#### The Riin

Two thousand years ago, the Eyendra was not empty. A civilization called the Riin flourished here—a people who practiced a form of magic that no longer exists, learned (some say) from the dragon Ezra Olkanis herself.

The Riin did not build cities in the conventional sense. They *grew* them. Their magic bound them to the land—their settlements were living extensions of the forest, their roads were paths that the trees permitted, their governance was intertwined with spirits of place. They did not conquer nature; they negotiated with it, and eventually became part of it.

For centuries, this worked. The Riin prospered. Their population grew. Their magic deepened.

Then they attempted the final step.

What exactly happened is unclear—the only witness is a dragon who does not explain herself. What is known: the Riin sought to make their bond with the land permanent. Not a relationship, but a merger. Immortality through dissolution. Civilization through diffusion.

They succeeded.

The Riin did not die. They *became* the forest. Their individual selves dissolved into Eyendra, their essence spreading through root and soil and water until the boundary between person and place ceased to exist. The Riin are still here—in every tree, every stone, every lake. They simply stopped being people.

The ruins they left behind are not abandoned. The forest grew through them, around them, *from* them. Structures half-stone and half-wood, walls that have become trunks, streets that have become clearings. The forest doesn't destroy the ruins; it incorporates them. And sometimes, in certain light, the ruins seem to remember what they were.

#### What Remains

The Riin merger was not clean. Their civilization did not vanish uniformly—it pooled and concentrated in certain places.

**The lakes of Wer Azenzi** are where the Riin presence pools most densely. These small lakes scattered through the northern forest occasionally display images on their surfaces—glimpses of Riin life, scenes from a civilization that no longer exists. People who linger too long near Wer Azenzi sometimes acquire knowledge they shouldn't have, or feel drawn toward the water in ways they can't explain. Extended exposure carries risks of a more permanent nature.

**The ruins in the Lygrone valley** are the most accessible—and the most disturbing. Foundation stones that hum when touched. Buried roads that glow faintly at night. The satyr who roam the Wycendeula plains refuse to enter this valley, and they won't explain why. Those who camp there report dreams of faces they don't recognize, speaking a language they almost understand.

**The deep interior** around Lean D'Riin is simply avoided. The few expeditions that have returned describe a forest that seems to *notice* them. Trees that weren't there a moment ago. Paths that loop back on themselves. The sense of being watched by something too large to have eyes. Most expeditions don't return at all.

#### Why It's Dangerous

Eyendra's danger is not monsters or weather, though both exist. The danger is the forest itself.

**The forest absorbs.** People who go too deep don't always come back, and those who do are sometimes... different. Changed in ways they can't articulate. A hunter who spent three days lost in Lean D'Riin returned speaking phrases in a language no one recognized—Riin, presumably. He couldn't stop. He walked into the forest a week later and never came out.

**The forest intrudes.** The Riin are not gone; they are *distributed*. Their presence persists in fragmentary form, and certain places make that presence felt. Standing in the wrong clearing might fill your head with sensations that aren't yours—emotions, urges, fragments of identity. Most people recover. Some don't.

**The forest protects itself.** Whether this is the dragon's doing or the Riin's diffused will or simply what happens when a civilization merges with its environment, the result is the same. Those who take too much, dig too deep, or disturb the wrong ruin face consequences. Not immediate violence—the forest is too patient for that. But paths close. Game vanishes. Water sources go bad. The forest makes it clear when you are no longer welcome.

#### Subregions

##### Lean D'Riin

The heart of ancient Riin civilization and the most dangerous section of Eyendra. The name means "Forest of the Riin" in their language—both a geographic label and a statement of ownership. The Riin built (grew) their largest settlements here, and here the merger was most complete.

The trees in Lean D'Riin are impossibly old—some are clearly older than the Riin civilization itself, suggesting the forest had power before the Riin ever arrived. The canopy is so thick that the forest floor exists in permanent twilight. Compass directions become unreliable. Time feels different, though whether this is psychological or actual is debated.

No one lives in Lean D'Riin. No one should go there unless they have business with the dragon or wish to disappear.

##### Lean D'Kas

The northwestern section, named for reasons lost. "Kas" might have been a Riin leader, a spirit, or a word whose meaning died with the language. Lean D'Kas is less dense than Lean D'Riin, less obviously malevolent, but still not safe.

The Riin settled here more lightly—seasonal camps rather than permanent cities. The ruins are smaller, more scattered, easier to miss. This makes Lean D'Kas more dangerous in some ways: travelers don't realize they've crossed into forbidden territory until the forest starts responding.

##### The Coastal Fringe

The only part of Eyendra that can be safely used. A strip roughly twenty miles deep along the coast, from Moornik Bay to the northern extent of the forest. The dragon permits extraction here—timber, herbs, game—and Zor's economy depends on it.

The coastal fringe is still boreal forest, still wild, but the Riin presence is thin enough that the land behaves normally. The trees are younger. The paths stay where you left them. The water doesn't show you things.

Zor's foresters know exactly where the safe zone ends. They mark the boundary with cairns that visitors are advised not to cross.

#### The Dragon's Domain

Ezra Olkanis dwells somewhere in the deep Lean D'Riin, roughly 120 miles west of Zor. The exact location has never been mapped—not because people haven't tried, but because those who get close enough don't come back to report.

The dragon and the forest have merged in their own way over the millennia. Some believe she is the forest's guardian. Others believe the forest is her extension. The truth may be simpler: after thousands of years in the same place, the distinction between the two has blurred.

What is certain is that nothing happens in Eyendra that the dragon doesn't eventually know about. The trees are not her spies—they don't need to be. She simply *listens*, in whatever way a dragon listens to a forest that was once a civilization she watched rise and fall.

#### Current Inhabitants

**Zor** is the only permanent settlement, a city-state on Moornik Bay that survives through the dragon's sufferance and careful observation of ancient rules.

**Ezra Olkanis** is the only dragon, ancient beyond reckoning, bound to this forest by ties no one fully understands.

**Wildlife** exists in normal forms along the coast and in corrupted forms deeper in. Wolves, bears, elk—the usual boreal fauna. But the animals of Lean D'Riin are different. Larger, or smaller, or wrong in ways that are hard to articulate. They don't behave like animals should.

**Spirits** of uncertain nature inhabit the ruins and the lakes. Not ghosts exactly—the Riin didn't die, so they didn't leave ghosts. But something remains that responds to attention and occasionally to speech. Scholars from Zor have documented dozens of interactions, none of them fully understood.

**No one else.** The satyr avoid the Lygrone valley. The Ulvsjael of Filvrae Sylvrym do not cross into Eyendra. Even the hardy settlers who push into Wycendeula's other wilderness regions give this forest a wide berth. The forest has made itself understood.

#### For Travelers

**Don't go.**

If you must go, stay in the coastal fringe. Hire a guide from Zor—they know the safe areas and the extraction rules. Do not take more than you need. Do not dig. Do not disturb ruins, even the small ones. Do not drink from lakes you don't recognize. Do not spend more than three days in the forest at a time.

If you go deeper despite all warning, leave something behind. A token, a name, a drop of blood. The forest notices those who enter without offering anything. Whether this actually helps is debated, but Zor's hunters swear by it.

If you feel the forest noticing you—if paths start closing, if game vanishes, if you hear your name spoken by no one—leave immediately. Don't look back. Don't return for anything you left behind.

And if you see the dragon, do not run. Running triggers pursuit. Stand still, show your hands, and wait. If she wants to speak with you, she will. If she doesn't, she'll let you go.

Probably.

### Fylvrae Sylvrym

Tags: forest, ulvsjael, geography

One of Alaria's largest continuous forests, Fylvrae Sylvrym blankets the western half of Wycendeula—a sea of ancient trees stretching roughly 700 miles north to south and 600 miles from the Bay of Wolves to the Kilbyurn Mountains. The forest has no roads, no settlements, no safe paths. It belongs entirely to the ulvsjael.

#### The Forest Itself

Fylvrae Sylvrym is old growth throughout. Trees here measure their ages in millennia; some of the heartwood oaks predate the God War. The canopy is dense enough to create perpetual twilight at ground level, broken only by rivers and the occasional clearing where something massive has fallen.

The undergrowth is surprisingly navigable in most areas—centuries of shade have prevented the explosive ground-level growth found in younger forests. What grows instead are fungi, moss carpets, and shade-tolerant ferns. The smell is rich decay and wet earth, punctuated by the sharp green scent of crushed fern where something large has passed.

Wildlife is abundant but wary. Deer, boar, and smaller game populate the forest in numbers, but they've learned caution. Anything that moves casually through Fylvrae Sylvrym doesn't survive long.

#### The Ulvsjael

Nearly a dozen nomadic packs roam Fylvrae Sylvrym—the largest concentration of ulvsjael anywhere in the world. These are not the cursed werewolves of northern Alaria, transformed by magic and trapped between forms. The ulvsjael are true-born wolf-kin, descended from Ulvma, Gaea's wolf son. They were born this way. Their parents were born this way. Their line stretches back millions of years.

The ulvsjael spend most of their existence in wolf form, massive creatures that hunt in coordinated silence. Only in times of extreme circumstance do councils convene in human form—and even then, the gatherings are brief. Human shape feels wrong to them, a costume worn for necessity.

The packs range in size from thirty to over a hundred individuals. Territory boundaries shift constantly through skirmish and negotiation. Some packs are relatively peaceful, content with their hunting grounds. Others are aggressive, expanding whenever opportunity presents. The balance of power reshuffles every generation.

Rumors persist that some packs have interbred with cursed werewolves from the north, incorporating transformation magic into bloodlines that never needed it. The purpose—if true—would be to expand their power, perhaps to produce offspring capable of infiltrating human society. No one has confirmed this. No one who could confirm it has survived to report.

#### Hidden Wealth

Beneath the forest floor lie hundreds of skystones—astral fragments that drifted down during some ancient cataclysm and were buried by millennia of leaf fall and root growth. A single skystone can fetch enough gold to buy a merchant ship. The forest floor is a fortune waiting to be claimed.

No one claims it.

The ulvsjael don't use skystones, don't trade them, and don't seem to care about them. But they care very much about their territory. Treasure hunters who enter the forest occasionally emerge with stones. Far more often, they simply vanish. The packs don't distinguish between innocent travelers and would-be thieves. All intruders are prey.

#### Navigation and Rivers

The only reliable features for navigation are the rivers, which thread through the forest like veins. The Twilight River is the largest, flowing west toward the Bay of Wolves. The Lilsau drains the southern reaches near the Eceraen foothills. Smaller tributaries are too numerous to name, and most lack names anyway—the satyr who might have named them don't enter, and the ulvsjael don't share their terms.

The rivers are also the primary hunting corridors for the packs. Prey must drink; the ulvsjael know this. Traveling along a riverbank is faster than pushing through the undergrowth but significantly more dangerous.

#### Bjorkin's Den

In the heart of Fylvrae Sylvrym, where the Twilight River bends north, lies the territory of Bjorkin—a void-attuned werewolf overlord who rules the most powerful pack in the forest.

Bjorkin is something unprecedented: an ulvsjael who has somehow achieved attunement to the Void element. Whether this came through exposure to a leyline convergence, pact with something from Nilus, or some other means is unknown. What matters is the result. Bjorkin can sense disturbances in reality, perceive across dimensional boundaries, and—reportedly—step briefly into the Void itself to ambush prey from impossible angles.

His pack has grown steadily over the past century, absorbing weaker groups and driving rivals to the forest's margins. Bjorkin rarely takes human form even for councils; when he does, witnesses describe a gaunt figure with eyes that seem to look through solid matter. He speaks little and never explains himself.

The den itself is located somewhere in the central forest, but its exact position seems to shift. Some who've escaped describe a clearing that appeared suddenly around them, ringed by wolves that emerged from shadows that shouldn't have been deep enough to hide them. Whether Bjorkin has somehow anchored a pocket of Void space to the material plane or simply knows the forest well enough to seem supernatural is an open question.

What's certain is that his territory—roughly the central third of the forest—is the most dangerous part of Fylvrae Sylvrym. Other packs hunt for food. Bjorkin's pack hunts for something else.

#### The Edges

The forest's margins are slightly less deadly. Along the Bay of Wolves coast, the trees thin into marshland and scrub. Near the Eceraen Mountains, altitude and rocky soil create gaps in the canopy. Around the Kilbyurn foothills, the transition to mountain terrain provides some defensible positions.

The Balduahr dwarves occasionally patrol the eastern forest edge, more to confirm the boundary than to enter. Satyr from the plains sometimes venture in from the east during lean seasons, though they rarely go deep. Along the western coast, the occasional shipwreck survivor has made it out alive—but only by moving fast and avoiding the interior entirely.

For practical purposes, Fylvrae Sylvrym is impassable. The only routes through Wycendeula go around it: the coastal passage along the Bay of Wolves, the mountain passes through the Kilbyurns, or the long eastern route across the satyr plains. Any path through the forest leads through ulvsjael territory, and the ulvsjael don't negotiate passage.

#### Seasonal Patterns

The forest has two notable seasonal shifts:

**Deep Winter**: Snow falls heavily in Fylvrae Sylvrym, muffling sound and obscuring trails. The packs are more active in winter—the cold doesn't bother them, but it slows their prey. This is when territorial conflicts peak, as packs push boundaries while rivals are hunting elsewhere.

**Faesummer**: When the Faesummer phenomenon intensifies light magic across Alaria, Fylvrae Sylvrym experiences peculiar effects. The canopy seems to thin despite no physical change, allowing shafts of intense light to pierce the gloom. The ulvsjael retreat to the deepest shade during these periods, hunting only at dawn and dusk. Some scholars speculate this vulnerability is why they avoid the eastern plains, which offer no cover from the light.

#### For Travelers

Don't.

If circumstances absolutely require passage through the forest, stay near water but not on the banks. Move during transitions—dawn and dusk—when pack activity is lowest. Travel light and fast; supplies attract attention. If you hear wolves, you're already surrounded—they don't vocalize until the hunt is decided. Pray to whatever powers you honor that they're not hungry.

Most importantly: don't take skystones. The packs may let a small party pass if they seem transient and unthreatening. They never let thieves leave. Whatever you dig up isn't worth what follows you out.

### Kama Sa'malina

Tags: lake, geography, dangerous, monsters, wycendeula

The lake district of southern Wycendeula—hundreds of bodies of water scattered across roughly three thousand square miles of boggy forest and scrubland, pressing against the northern edge of the Pale Death. From above, it looks like shattered glass. From the ground, it's a labyrinth of cold water, unstable terrain, and things that hunt.

Kama Sa'malina has no permanent settlements. No roads cross it. The few who enter do so because they're lost, desperate, or stupid. The region's reputation is earned: this is where the continent's isolation and the Pale Death's hostility combine to create a predator's paradise.

#### Geography

Kama Sa'malina occupies the southeastern corner of Wycendeula's habitable zone, beginning where the Eberri Ygonzi forest thins and extending south until the ground becomes permafrost. The lakes vary from ponds to bodies several miles across, connected by streams, marshes, and waterlogged terrain that makes overland travel brutal.

The ground is unreliable. What looks solid may be floating vegetation over deep water. What looks shallow may drop suddenly into cold darkness. The lakes themselves are glacial remnants, carved by ice sheets that retreated tens of thousands of years ago, but the terrain has continued shifting—new lakes appear, old ones drain, and the maps that exist are never quite accurate.

The southern edge blurs into the Pale Death's frozen wastes. In winter, the distinction vanishes entirely. In summer, things come north from the glaciers.

#### Why It's Dangerous

Kama Sa'malina's danger is not supernatural. It's ecological. The region is too remote for systematic hunting, too harsh for permanent settlement, and perfectly suited for predators that would be exterminated anywhere civilization could reach them.

**The Gilthrain**

The lakes' apex predators. Gilthrain resemble eels grown to horrifying size—twelve to twenty feet long, thick as a man's torso, with circular mouths ringed by backward-curving teeth. They hunt by vibration, sensing movement on the water's surface or the shore. A single gilthrain is dangerous. A colony is unsurvivable.

Gilthrain can survive out of water for hours, dragging themselves across land between lakes. They hunt cooperatively, driving prey toward ambush points. They're intelligent enough to learn from failed attacks. Colonies communicate through low-frequency sounds that travel through both water and ground—if you feel a deep humming in your chest near a lake, you're already being tracked.

They don't hunt for food alone. Gilthrain are territorial, and they seem to kill anything that enters their domain whether hungry or not. Bodies are sometimes found untouched except for the wounds that killed them.

**The Pallid**

Things that come down from the Pale Death when winter deepens. Humanoid, bone-white, moving with a stuttering gait that looks wrong even at a distance. The Pallid don't speak, don't react to calls, don't stop. They follow prey for days, never running, never resting, closing distance through relentless endurance.

What the Pallid are is unclear. They're not undead—they bleed when cut, die when killed. They're not constructs—their bodies are organic, though the anatomy is subtly wrong. Some scholars believe they're humans transformed by the Pale Death, adapted to the cold until nothing human remains. Others believe they're something that was never human at all.

The Pallid don't seem to eat what they kill. Bodies are found frozen, undisturbed except by scavengers. This has led to theories that the Pallid kill for reasons unrelated to sustenance—territorial behavior, or something stranger. No one has successfully captured a Pallid for study. The attempts that came close ended badly.

**Other Threats**

The gilthrain and Pallid are the worst, but hardly the only dangers:

- **Bristle-wolves**: Pack hunters adapted to the lake terrain. Partially webbed paws, oily fur that sheds water, and the patience to wait in ambush for days. They don't attack large groups, but anyone who falls behind or separates becomes prey.
- **Lake-lurkers**: Ambush predators that resemble floating logs or vegetation until something gets close enough. Not as dangerous as gilthrain, but more numerous and less predictable.
- **The cold itself**: Kama Sa'malina's lakes are glacial—cold enough to kill through shock, cold enough to make swimming impossible even in summer. Falling in is often fatal even without predators.

#### The Deeper Lakes

The southern lakes—closest to the Pale Death—are different. Deeper, colder, with water so clear you can see the bottom fifty feet down. Nothing lives in them. No fish, no plants, no gilthrain. Just cold, empty water.

This should make them safer. Instead, people avoid them more than the predator-filled northern lakes. The emptiness is wrong. Water that cold and clean should support life. It doesn't. Something about those lakes is inimical to living things in ways no one has explained.

Local theory holds that the deep lakes are connected to whatever makes the Pale Death what it is. The water may carry the same property that makes the glacial interior lifeless. Drinking from the deep lakes is forbidden not because anyone has tested what happens, but because no one wants to find out.

#### Travel Through Kama Sa'malina

**Don't.**

The region has no value that justifies the risk. No rare resources, no ruins worth looting, no paths that save meaningful time over going around. The only reasons to enter are desperation or ignorance.

For those who must:

- **Travel in winter**: Counterintuitive, but the frozen lakes are safer than the liquid ones. Gilthrain become sluggish in deep cold. The Pallid are more active, but they can be outrun on solid ground.
- **Stay off the ice in shoulder seasons**: The freeze and thaw periods are when the ice is unpredictable and the gilthrain are hungriest.
- **Move fast**: The longer you stay, the more likely something finds you. Plan routes that minimize time in the region, not distance.
- **Avoid the shores**: Gilthrain hunt the edges. If you must approach water, do it quickly and loudly—they prefer ambush to direct confrontation.
- **Never travel alone**: A group can watch in multiple directions, rotate rest, and potentially fight off smaller threats. Alone, you're prey.
- **If you hear humming, run**: That's gilthrain coordination. They've spotted you and they're positioning.

#### The Few Who Enter

Hunters occasionally work the northern fringes, where gilthrain colonies are smaller and bristle-wolf pelts fetch good prices. They never go deep, never stay long, and lose people regularly despite their experience.

Criminals sometimes flee into Kama Sa'malina when pursuit is close enough that death in the lakes seems preferable to capture. Most are never seen again. A few emerge on the other side, changed in ways that go beyond physical trauma.

Scholars have mounted expeditions to study the deep lakes, the Pallid, the ecosystem that produces such efficient predators. The expeditions that return bring back observations. The ones that don't become observations themselves.

#### Hooks

- **Something came out.** A gilthrain colony has established itself in a lake system north of their usual range—close enough to threaten trade routes. Someone needs to drive them back or kill them, and the locals are offering significant payment.

- **A Pallid was captured.** A trapper in the northern fringes claims to have one alive, bound in a root cellar. He's asking for a fortune to let scholars study it. The opportunity is unprecedented. The risk is obvious.

- **The deep lakes are changing.** Travelers report that one of the lifeless southern lakes now has things in it—shapes moving under the surface, too deep to identify. If the deep lakes are becoming habitable, the question is: habitable for what?

- **Someone survived.** A prisoner sentenced to death was given the traditional alternative: walk into Kama Sa'malina. She was expected to die. Instead, she emerged three months later from the southern edge, having crossed the entire region. She won't say how. She won't say what she saw. But she's carrying something wrapped in oilcloth that she won't let anyone touch.

### Kilburn Mountains

A mountain range in Wycendeula.

TODO

### Kilbyurn Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography

A massive mountain range forming the western boundary of Wycendeula, separating the plains from the Farlands beyond. The Kilbyurn range is taller and more rugged than the Grognil to the northeast, with jagged peaks that remain snow-capped year-round and valleys choked with ancient forests.

#### The Empty Mountains

No one lives in the Kilbyurn Mountains. Not hermits, not bandits, not even the satyrs who have claimed every other corner of Wycendeula. The dwarves of Balduahr know better than to try. The range is home to things that make settlement impossible—and make crossing it a last resort.

The Kilbyurns lack leyline activity, which rules out magical corruption. What they have instead is a concentration of apex predators and territorial megafauna that has never been successfully culled. Expeditions from Balduahr in centuries past attempted to establish mining outposts; none survived longer than a season.

#### Known Hazards

**Granite Wyrms**: Serpentine creatures that burrow through solid rock, drawn to vibration. Mining operations attract them. A full-grown specimen can collapse a tunnel system in hours.

**Cloudwalkers**: Enormous, silent predators that drift between peaks on thermals. They resemble tattered sheets of pale leather until they fold around prey. Settlements attract attention; isolated travelers are safer.

**The Thornback Swarms**: Insectoid creatures the size of dogs that hunt in coordinated packs of hundreds. They nest in the forested valleys and strip large animals to bone in minutes. Fire deters them temporarily.

**Mountain Drakes**: Not true dragons, but close enough. Territorial, aggressive, and numerous enough that the skies over the Kilbyurns are contested airspace. The drakes hunt anything that moves in the open.

#### Rivers and Headwaters

The Kilbyurn range is the source of several major waterways:

- **Buzagi Wempu**: A fast, cold river originating in the northern Kilbyurns. It flows northeast, eventually feeding into the Shizander.
- **Tyerferniin**: A southern river draining toward the Eceraen foothills.
- **Mydruli River**: The largest river system in eastern Wycendeula originates in the central Kilbyurns, fed by glacial melt.

#### Crossing the Kilbyurns

Three passes are theoretically traversable, though none are safe:

**The Shriek Pass** (northern): Named for the constant wind that howls through the gap. Fastest crossing, but fully exposed—cloudwalkers hunt freely here.

**Thornback Gap** (central): Lower elevation, but the route passes through swarm territory. Only viable in deep winter when the swarms hibernate.

**Frozen Way** (southern): A glacial route that adds weeks to the journey but avoids the worst predator zones. Still dangerous; the ice shifts unpredictably.

#### The Giant Question

Balduahr's historical records describe giants in the mountains west of their territory, and expeditions have occasionally reported enormous humanoid figures moving on distant ridgelines. Whether these are true giants, an unknown species, or something else entirely remains unconfirmed—no expedition has gotten close enough to verify and returned.

What is confirmed: something very large occasionally descends from the high peaks to drink at the mountain lakes. The tracks are unmistakable.

### Lean D'Riin

Tags: forest, geography, riin, eyendra

The central and most ancient section of the Eyendra forest. The name means "Forest of the Riin" in the language of the civilization that once flourished here—a people who merged with the land two thousand years ago and now exist only as a diffuse presence throughout the forest.

Lean D'Riin is the heart of ancient Riin civilization and the most dangerous part of Eyendra. The Riin built (grew) their largest settlements here, and here the merger between people and land was most complete. The trees are impossibly old—some predate the Riin civilization itself—and the canopy is so thick that the forest floor exists in permanent twilight.

No one lives in Lean D'Riin. No one should go there unless they have business with the dragon Ezra Olkanis or wish to disappear.

See the main **Eyendra** entry for full details on the forest, the Riin, and the dangers of the interior.

### Mirror Lakes

Tags: lake, geography, wycendeula

A cluster of small lakes in southwestern Wycendeula, tucked into the hills where the Neurian range meets the northwestern edge of Eberri Ygonzi. Unlike the predator-infested waters of Kama Sa'malina or the psychological horror of Trauma Lake, the Mirror Lakes are merely... strange.

#### Geography

The Mirror Lakes comprise roughly a dozen bodies of water ranging from small ponds to lakes covering a few hundred acres. They occupy a series of natural basins in the foothills, connected by streams and seepage. The surrounding terrain is mixed—rocky slopes above, boggy lowlands below, with stands of conifers providing cover from the wind.

The lakes sit at the northwestern corner of the dangerous southern region, which makes them the first water many travelers encounter when crossing from the Neurian Hills toward the interior. This has given them an outsized reputation as a waypoint, despite offering no services or settlements.

#### The Stillness

The Mirror Lakes are unnaturally calm. Even in strong wind, even during storms, the water barely ripples. The surface reflects with near-perfect clarity—sky, trees, and approaching figures reproduced so precisely that travelers sometimes mistake the reflection for a second group of people.

This stillness is not magical in any detectable sense. Scholars have tested the water, the local wind patterns, the basin geography. Nothing explains why these particular lakes should be calmer than any others. They simply are.

The stillness creates practical problems. Without ripples to break the reflection, judging the water's edge becomes difficult. The transition from shore to lake is invisible in certain light. People have walked into the Mirror Lakes without realizing they'd left solid ground—awkward and cold, but rarely dangerous since the lakes are shallow.

More disturbing: the reflections are *too* accurate. Details that shouldn't be visible at a distance appear clearly in the water. Travelers have seen their own faces reflected from fifty feet away, expression perfectly legible. Some report seeing details in the reflection that they couldn't see directly—movement in the treeline behind them, figures on the far shore, things that may or may not have been there when they turned to check.

#### What Lives Here

The Mirror Lakes support normal wildlife—fish, waterfowl, the small mammals that live around any freshwater source. Nothing unusual, nothing threatening. The lakes' proximity to Eberri Ygonzi keeps major predators away; coilwights don't venture this far from dense forest, and the open terrain discourages bristle-wolves.

This makes the Mirror Lakes one of the few relatively safe water sources in the region. Travelers crossing the southern wilds often stop here specifically because it's not trying to kill them.

#### Local Use

Hunters and trappers working the edges of Eberri Ygonzi use the Mirror Lakes as a staging area. It's close enough to the forest to make day-trips viable, far enough to sleep safely. Informal camps get established during peak hunting season, though no one stays permanently.

The locals have developed superstitions about the lakes:
- Don't look at your reflection for too long (you might see something you shouldn't)
- Don't camp directly on the shore (the stillness affects sleep)
- Don't fish after dark (the water sees better in darkness than you do)

Whether these superstitions have basis in actual experience or are simply the accumulation of unease is unclear. The Mirror Lakes aren't *dangerous*, exactly. They're just... watched. That's how people describe it. Not malevolently. Just attention, from something that shouldn't be paying attention.

#### Hooks

- **The reflection moved.** A hunter swears his reflection waved at him—a gesture he didn't make. He fled and hasn't returned, but his gear is still at the lake camp. Someone needs to retrieve it. Someone willing to look at the water.

- **The perfect map.** A cartographer theorizes that the Mirror Lakes' reflections could map areas the cartographer can't reach directly—showing, perhaps, what lies on the other side of hills, or deeper into Eberri Ygonzi than anyone has safely traveled. He's looking for assistants willing to help him test this theory.

- **Something's in the water.** A body has been found floating in one of the Mirror Lakes—the first death ever recorded here. The body is face-down, seemingly drowned, but no one can explain how an experienced woodsman would drown in four feet of still water. More disturbing: his reflection is still visible in the lake, even though the body has been removed.

### Mylentonuri

### Nabledron

Tags: fortress, ruins, poi, leyline

A ruined fortress on Wycendeula's eastern coast, built at the intersection of the force and fire leylines where they cross into God's Bathtub. Once the ambitious project of a Free Isles noble, now a shattered monument to the dangers of leyline experimentation.

#### History

Roysann of the Free Isles was wealthy, brilliant, and convinced he could revolutionize warfare. His plan was elegant in theory: use force magic to compress fire into stable spheres of glass, creating weapons of devastating power that could be manufactured and stockpiled. The leyline crossing at Nabledron provided the raw magical energy; all he needed was to harness it.

For three years, the project showed promise. Roysann's artificers produced dozens of successful prototypes—fist-sized glass orbs containing compressed flames that burned with unusual intensity when shattered. The fortress grew as funding poured in from interested parties across Alaria.

The catastrophe occurred during an attempt to scale up production. A batch of larger orbs—intended as siege weapons—proved unstable. One cracked. The chain reaction that followed destroyed the central workshops, killed Roysann and his senior artificers, and scattered burning glass across a mile radius. The fortress's outer walls survived; everything inside did not.

#### The Ruins Today

Nabledron's stone walls still stand, blackened and partially collapsed but recognizable as military architecture. The interior is a maze of fused stone, twisted metal, and glass—some of it still dangerously hot centuries later. The leylines continue to pulse through the site, feeding residual fires that burn without fuel in the deepest chambers.

The ruins are not uninhabited. Creatures drawn to elemental energy have claimed various sections:

**Glass Spawn**: Semi-molten entities that formed from the original catastrophe, animated by the leyline crossing. They resemble humanoid figures made of flowing glass and liquid fire. They don't leave the ruins but will attack anything that enters.

**Fire Elementals**: The sustained leyline exposure has created a thin point to Yolus, allowing minor fire elementals to slip through. They're drawn to the glass spawn but will attack other intruders.

**Scavengers**: Despite the dangers, treasure hunters periodically attempt the ruins. Some seek Roysann's notes; others hunt for intact fire orbs, which command extraordinary prices. Most don't return. Those who do rarely go back.

#### The Surviving Orbs

Not all of Roysann's creations were destroyed. An unknown number of fire orbs survived the catastrophe—some scattered across the surrounding terrain, others buried in the ruins. They remain stable until cracked, at which point they release their compressed contents explosively.

Finding an intact orb is worth a fortune. The Free Isles, various military powers, and private collectors all pay premium prices. The catch is extraction: the orbs are scattered through glass spawn territory, often half-buried in fused debris, and the ruins themselves are actively hostile.

Several confirmed orbs have reached the market over the centuries. At least one was used in an assassination. Others sit in private collections, their owners gambling that stability will hold.

#### The Leyline Crossing

The force and fire leylines intersect directly beneath the central ruins, creating a zone of amplified and unpredictable magical effects. This is what made Roysann's project possible—and what made his failure so catastrophic.

Effects near the crossing include:
- Flames that burn in unusual colors and resist extinguishing
- Objects that become difficult to move or stop once in motion
- Sudden temperature spikes or drops
- Glass that forms spontaneously from superheated sand and dust

The leylines continue into God's Bathtub from here, their effects dissipating over the water. Sailors report occasional thermal plumes and strange currents offshore.

#### Approaching Nabledron

The ruins are visible from considerable distance—the blackened walls stand out against the pale coastal terrain. No roads lead here anymore; the land route requires crossing either the White Wastes or the coastal scrublands, both difficult terrain.

Approach by sea is theoretically possible but complicated by the leyline effects on coastal waters. Ships report unpredictable currents and occasional steam vents. The Pugrai lakes to the south create navigation hazards of their own.

Most expeditions approach overland from the north, following the coast from Caffas territory. The journey takes several days and requires careful provisioning—there's nothing between Nabledron and the mountains but empty wasteland.

### Neurian Hills

Hills in Wycendeula.

### Plains of Wycendeula

Tags: plains, geography

A vast grassland stretching across eastern Wycendeula, from the Kilbyurn Mountains in the west to the shores of God's Bathtub in the east. The plains are fertile, well-watered by several river systems, and completely overrun with satyrs.

#### The Satyr Occupation

The plains hold perhaps a hundred thousand satyrs scattered across thousands of temporary camps. Buffalo hide tents dot the landscape; herds of wild cattle and horses provide sustenance. The satyr follow the herds, moving with the seasons, leaving little permanent mark on the land.

Despite the fertile soil, no farming exists. The satyr lack the social organization to establish agriculture—or perhaps they simply don't want to. Attempts by outsiders to settle the plains have universally failed, overwhelmed by sheer numbers before any fortification could be completed.

Despite having no formal government, rumors of a self-proclaimed king of the satyr have begun to spread. A satyr of dark and mysterious origins, with ambitions to unite all of the satyr. These rumors terrify Balduahr, the smaller dwarven kingdom in the southwest, which would have no hopes of defending itself if all of the satyr across Wycendeula united.

#### What Lies Beneath

The satyr are not the first inhabitants of these plains.

Beneath the grass and topsoil lie the remains of a human civilization that flourished here in the distant past—cities, roads, temples, and farms, now buried under centuries of accumulated earth. The satyr ignore these ruins; they have no interest in the past and no use for stone buildings. But the ruins are there, waiting.

Evidence of the old civilization surfaces regularly: foundation stones exposed by erosion, metal objects turned up by burrowing animals, carved fragments in riverbanks where floods cut through the soil. The architecture suggests a prosperous, organized society—nothing like the nomadic camps that occupy the surface today.

What happened to them remains unclear. The satyr arrived at some point—migrated, invaded, or simply drifted in—and the humans are gone. Whether they were conquered, displaced, absorbed, or destroyed by something else entirely, no records survive to say. The satyr themselves have no oral history of the conquest; as far as they're concerned, the plains have always been theirs.

#### The Deep Ruins

The surface evidence hints at what lies below. In a few locations, natural features have exposed deeper structures:

**River-Cut Foundations**: The Mydruli and its tributaries have carved through the buried city layer in places, revealing walls, floors, and occasionally intact chambers. Most are flooded or collapsed, but some remain accessible. Treasure hunters who brave the satyr occasionally investigate these sites.

**Sinkhole Exposures**: The plains have several areas where the ground has collapsed into underground voids—basements, cisterns, or tunnel systems from the old civilization. The satyr avoid these sinkholes, claiming they're haunted or cursed. Explorers who've descended report extensive underground construction, largely intact but dark and silent.

**The Lygrone Valley**: The area around the Lygrone River shows unusually dense evidence of habitation. Surface ruins are more common here, and the satyr population is notably thinner. Something about the valley discourages them—or something they remember discourages them, even if they won't say what.

#### Archaeological Interest

The buried civilization of Wycendeula represents one of Alaria's great historical mysteries. Who were they? How advanced? Why did they fall? The answers lie beneath the plains, preserved by the same satyr occupation that prevents investigation.

Serious archaeological work is effectively impossible. Any expedition large enough to excavate is large enough to attract satyr attention. Small groups can sometimes slip through, but they can't stay long enough to accomplish meaningful study. The few artifacts that have been recovered—mostly by treasure hunters—suggest a culture with advanced metallurgy, sophisticated architecture, and extensive trade connections. Beyond that, speculation outpaces evidence.

Some scholars theorize the civilization's fall is connected to the same forces that created the White Wastes or the cursed features of the Grognil Mountains. Others suggest the satyr themselves were the cause—that they arrived in overwhelming numbers and simply took what they wanted. A minority view holds that the humans are still there, somehow, in the deepest levels—that the civilization retreated underground rather than face destruction.

The truth, whatever it is, waits beneath the grass.

#### Traveling the Plains

Crossing the Plains of Wycendeula is possible but risky. The satyr are not uniformly hostile—small groups are often ignored, especially if they avoid camps and keep moving. But large groups, slow-moving caravans, or anyone who appears to be settling will draw attention.

The main hazards:
- **Satyr bands**: Opportunistic rather than organized, but dangerous in numbers
- **Wildlife**: Buffalo herds can trample the unwary; predators follow the herds
- **Distance**: The plains are vast, water sources are the rivers, and shelter is nonexistent
- **The buried ruins**: Sinkholes appear without warning; what's underneath isn't always empty

The few established routes cross the northern plains near the White Wastes, where satyr density is lower and Caffas traders occasionally pass. Southern routes through the Lygrone valley are faster but less traveled—the satyr may avoid the area, but travelers report the same unease.

### The Pugrai Lakes

Tags: lakes, geography, leyline

Three coastal lakes along Wycendeula's eastern shore where the White Wastes meet God's Bathtub. The lakes—Pugrai D'had, Pugrai Shisk, and Pugrai Naihim—share a common characteristic that has puzzled scholars: their waters are unnaturally still.

#### The Stillwater Phenomenon

The Pugrai lakes barely ripple. Wind that should churn the surface produces only faint tremors. Objects dropped into the water sink with dreamlike slowness. Swimming is possible but exhausting—the water resists movement in all directions.

This effect intensifies closer to the lakes' centers. Boats attempting to cross report that oars become nearly useless; poling from the shallows is the only reliable propulsion. At the deepest points, the water becomes so resistant that escape requires tremendous effort. Several bodies have been recovered floating motionless in the central zones, preserved by the cold and the strange medium.

#### The Leyline Connection

The force leyline passes through this region, and most scholars attribute the stillwater phenomenon to its influence. The leyline—associated with kinetic manipulation and motion arrest—appears to bleed into the water table. The effect is strongest in Pugrai Naihim, the largest lake, and weakest in Pugrai Shisk.

The fire leyline also crosses nearby (both converge at Nabledron to the north), but fire's influence is less apparent. Water temperature in the lakes is slightly elevated year-round, preventing full freezing even in winter.

#### Pugrai D'had

The northernmost lake, where the Krelfassa river meets the coast. D'had is the shallowest of the three and the stillwater effect is relatively mild—boats can cross with effort. The river mouth creates a mixing zone where normal water meets stillwater, producing strange currents that curl back on themselves.

Local legend claims D'had was once a harbor in ancient times, before the leylines shifted. No archaeological evidence supports this, though the lakebed is littered with debris too deep to recover easily.

#### Pugrai Shisk

The smallest lake, positioned between D'had and Naihim. Shisk is notable for its clarity—the stillwater effect means sediment never rises, and visibility extends to the bottom in most areas. Fish exist here but move in slow, languid patterns. They're easy to catch but taste faintly metallic.

Rumors persist of shapes visible in Shisk's depths—regular geometric forms that don't match natural formations. No one has successfully dived deep enough to investigate; the water's resistance makes descent exhausting and ascent terrifying.

#### Pugrai Naihim

The largest and most dangerous lake, fed by the Elmynfrosk river from the north. Naihim's center is effectively impassable—the stillwater effect is so pronounced that even objects thrown in arc slowly rather than splash. Local satyr tribes consider the lake sacred or cursed (the distinction is unclear) and avoid its shores entirely.

What makes Naihim unique is the sound. On still nights, those near the shore report a low, constant vibration—not quite a hum, more a pressure in the ears. The sound comes from the water itself, as if something vast is holding very, very still at the bottom.

#### The Pugrai Name

"Pugrai" appears in no known language spoken in modern Wycendeula. The satyr adopted the name from whoever came before them. Some scholars connect it to ancient human tongues from before the plains fell; others suggest it predates human settlement entirely.

The word's meaning is unknown, though its consistent application to stillwater features suggests it was descriptive rather than commemorative.

### Rivers of Wycendeula

Tags: rivers, geography

Wycendeula's river systems drain the Kilbyurn Mountains and surrounding highlands, flowing east across the plains toward God's Bathtub. Each river has developed its own character, shaped by the terrain it crosses and—in some cases—the leylines it intersects.

#### Major River Systems

##### The Twilight River

The largest river in western Wycendeula, the Twilight River drains the heart of Fylvrae Sylvrym before emptying into the Bay of Wolves. The river originates somewhere in the central forest—its exact headwaters are unknown, as they lie deep in ulvsjael territory—and flows generally westward for over 200 miles.

The Twilight River takes its name from the permanent gloom along its banks. The forest canopy closes over the water for most of its course, creating a tunnel of shadow broken only by occasional gaps where massive trees have fallen. Even at midday, the light along the Twilight River resembles early evening elsewhere.

The river is navigable by small craft for much of its length, though the slow current provides little help. More significantly, the riverbanks serve as the primary hunting corridors for ulvsjael packs. The wolves know that prey must drink, and they patrol the water's edge constantly. Travelers who follow the river move faster than those pushing through undergrowth, but they're far more likely to encounter hunters.

Near its mouth, the Twilight River broadens and slows, spreading into the Octavus Marsh before reaching the bay. This final stretch is the safest portion—the marsh terrain discourages pack tactics—but it's still ulvsjael territory.

##### The Lilsau

A smaller river draining the southern reaches of Fylvrae Sylvrym, flowing southwest toward the Eceraen foothills. The Lilsau originates in the hills near the Carcass Hills and runs roughly parallel to the Wolfmaw peninsula before reaching the coast south of the bay.

The Lilsau is narrow and fast-moving, fed by numerous small tributaries from the surrounding forest. Its waters are clearer than the Twilight River's—the limestone of the Carcass Hills filters the sediment—and support populations of trout-like fish that are one of the few reliable food sources in this area.

The river's course takes it through less densely forested terrain than most of western Wycendeula. The Carcass Hills create gaps in the canopy, and the foothills to the south are rockier and more open. This makes the Lilsau corridor one of the relatively safer routes through the region, though "safer" still means ulvsjael patrols rather than guaranteed confrontation.

##### The Voules

A tributary of the Lilsau, flowing south through the Carcass Hills. The Voules is small—barely twenty feet wide at its broadest—but significant as one of the few water sources in the otherwise dry hills.

The river runs clear and cold, filtered through the limestone that gives the Carcass Hills their character. The taste is slightly mineral, not unpleasant but distinctive. The Voules passes within a mile of The Citadel ruins, providing water access for anyone attempting to explore the ancient city-state.

##### The Davred

A forest river in the northern portion of Fylvrae Sylvrym, flowing generally south before joining the Twilight River system. The Davred is notable primarily for the large satyr camps that once existed along its banks—now abandoned after the ulvsjael expanded their territory centuries ago.

The river passes through some of the densest old-growth forest in Wycendeula. The trees along its banks are enormous, their root systems intertwined with the river itself. In places, the channel flows through natural tunnels formed by root masses, creating enclosed passages that are excellent ambush points.

##### The Cyatri

A smaller tributary in the eastern forest, flowing south from the Kilbyurn foothills. The Cyatri marks the rough boundary between deep ulvsjael territory and the transition zone approaching Balduahr's patrols.

The river is fast and rocky, descending from the mountains through a series of rapids and small waterfalls. The noise of the water can mask approaching threats—or mask your own movement, depending on perspective. Ulvsjael packs hunt along the Cyatri less frequently than along the interior rivers, as the terrain suits their tactics less well.

##### The Syla Mur

A mountain-fed river on the eastern edge of the forest, draining the western Kilbyurn slopes before joining the Shivyll system in Balduahr territory. The Syla Mur is technically outside the main Fylvrae Sylvrym forest, running through the transition zone where trees give way to mountain terrain.

Balduahr patrols occasionally follow the Syla Mur upstream, using it as a scouting route into the forest edge. The dwarves don't enter the deep forest, but they monitor the boundary. The ulvsjael, for their part, rarely push this far east—the open mountain terrain doesn't suit their tactics, and they have no interest in the dwarves' rocky territories.

##### The Mydruli

The largest river in eastern Wycendeula, originating in the central Kilbyurn Mountains. The Mydruli flows east-southeast across the Plains of Wycendeula, eventually reaching the coast south of the Cobbled Coast peninsula.

The Mydruli is fed by glacial melt and runs cold year-round. Its waters are clean and support abundant fish populations—one of the few reliable food sources on the plains besides the buffalo herds. Satyr camps cluster along its banks more densely than elsewhere, though even here settlement is temporary.

Ancient bridge foundations span the Mydruli at several points, remnants of the human civilization that once occupied these plains. The satyr ignore them, but treasure hunters occasionally attempt to excavate the riverbanks.

##### The Shivyll

Balduahr's primary river, flowing southeast from the mountains into the plains. The Shivyll originates near Ironforge, passes east of Graystone through a defended gorge, and emerges onto the lowlands near Plainwatch.

For Balduahr, the Shivyll is both lifeline and vulnerability. The river provides water, hydropower for the forges, and a transportation route for ore. It also provides an invasion path. The gorge section is heavily fortified, but the lower Shivyll is difficult to defend. Balduahr patrols the river extensively and maintains watchtowers along its length.

Beyond Balduahr's control, the Shivyll becomes satyr territory. The river eventually joins the Lygrone before reaching the coast.

##### The Lygrone

A slower, wider river in southeastern Wycendeula, fed by the Shivyll and several minor tributaries. The Lygrone meanders across flat terrain, creating marshland in its lower reaches before emptying into God's Bathtub.

The Lygrone valley shows more signs of ancient habitation than anywhere else on the plains—foundation stones, buried roads, and occasional surface ruins are common. The satyr seem to avoid the area more than geography would explain. Whether this is superstition or something they know that outsiders don't is unclear.

##### The Ilyu

A western tributary system flowing from the lower Kilbyurn range. The Ilyu is smaller than the Mydruli but significant as the primary water source for the western plains.

The river crosses terrain that the satyr claim is haunted—camps along the Ilyu report more disturbances than elsewhere, and several tributaries are avoided entirely. The satyr won't explain why. Whatever the cause, the western plains near the Ilyu are less densely occupied than the eastern regions.

#### White Wastes Rivers

##### The Yuforhi

The infamous River Yuforhi flows through the heart of the White Wastes, carrying waters that induce euphoria in those who drink or bathe in them. The effect intensifies during the hottest season, making long-term settlement impossible. See *The White Wastes* entry for full details.

##### The Krelfassa

Flowing east from the Caffas Mountains toward the coast, the Krelfassa passes through the northern White Wastes before emptying into Pugrai D'had. Unlike the Yuforhi, Krelfassa's waters are safe—cold mountain runoff that hasn't absorbed whatever contaminant gives Yuforhi its properties.

The Krelfassa marks an informal boundary between the White Wastes proper and the coastal lowlands. North of the river, survival is possible; south of it, the Wastes begin in earnest.

##### The Elmynfrosk

A southeastern drainage from the Caffas range, the Elmynfrosk flows through the eastern White Wastes before reaching Pugrai Naihim. The river's character changes as it approaches the coast—the stillwater effect from the Pugrai lakes extends upstream, slowing the current to an eerie crawl for the final miles.

Orc and goblin tribes use the upper Elmynfrosk as a water source but avoid the lower reaches. They claim the slow water is a trap—that things wait in the sluggish current for prey to wade in.

##### The Shizander

Originating in the northeastern Kilbyurn Mountains at the Buzagi Wempu headwaters, the Shizander flows east through the northern plains before curving south toward the White Wastes. The river eventually dissipates into the desert sands, though during wet seasons its lower reaches can extend considerably.

The Shizander is notable for temperature fluctuations—the water runs warm in some sections and cold in others, with no consistent pattern. Local theory suggests underground thermal vents, but no one has investigated thoroughly.

#### The Tyerferniin

A southern river draining the lower Kilbyurns toward the Eceraen foothills. The Tyerferniin falls outside the main Wycendeula drainage and eventually joins systems flowing into Venalthier.

#### The Buzagi Wempu

More a mountain torrent than a proper river, the Buzagi Wempu crashes down from the northern Kilbyurns before calming into the Shizander. The name is satyr in origin, meaning roughly "screaming white"—a reference to the rapids that dominate its upper course.

### Teardrop Lakes

Tags: lake, geography, eyendra, riin

A cluster of small lakes in eastern Eyendra, marking the northern edge of the Kama Sa'malina lake district. The Teardrop Lakes share some characteristics with their southern neighbors—occasional visual anomalies, a sense of being watched—but the effects are milder here, suggesting the Riin presence is less concentrated.

The name is descriptive: from above, the lakes form a rough teardrop pattern, tapering toward the southeast where they merge into Kama Sa'malina proper. Whether this shape is natural or was intentionally created by the Riin is debated.

The dragon pact does not explicitly forbid approaching the Teardrop Lakes, but Zor's people avoid them anyway. Close enough to Kama Sa'malina to share its reputation, far enough from the coast to offer no practical benefit—the risk exceeds the reward.

See **Kama Sa'malina** for details on the main lake district and **Eyendra** for the forest as a whole.

### The Nox

Tags: hills, forest, geography, dangerous, supernatural, wycendeula

The hills at the heart of Eberri Ygonzi, where the forest grows wrong and light goes to die. The Nox is not simply more dangerous than the surrounding wilderness—it is categorically different. Eberri Ygonzi will kill you with teeth and venom and cold. The Nox will kill you with darkness itself.

No one knows how The Nox came to be. It isn't a leyline effect—scholars have checked. It isn't planar bleeding—the usual markers are absent. Whatever makes The Nox what it is predates human presence in Wycendeula and has resisted every attempt at explanation.

#### The Darkness

The Nox is dark. Not dim, not shadowed—*dark*. The canopy doesn't explain it; other forests have equally thick canopy and still admit light. In The Nox, light sources fail. Torches burn but don't illuminate. Magical light flickers and dies. Even in clearings where sky should be visible, the darkness presses in.

The darkness isn't empty. It moves. It pools in places like water, flows around obstacles, rises and falls with a rhythm no one has mapped to any cycle. Travelers who've survived The Nox report that the darkness seemed to follow them—thickening when they tried to move quickly, thinning when they stood still, always pressing at the edges of whatever light they could maintain.

The darkness consumes.

People who stay in The Nox too long begin to fade. Not metaphorically—literally. Their edges blur. Their colors drain. They become harder to see, harder to hear, harder to remember. If they stay long enough, they vanish entirely, leaving no body and no trace except a space where someone should be.

#### What Hunts Here

The creatures of Eberri Ygonzi avoid The Nox. Coilwights don't enter. Thornbacks flee from its borders. Even wolves and bears give the hills wide berth. The darkness has its own predators, things that have adapted to hunt in conditions where sight is meaningless.

**Hollow Hounds**

Eyeless, earless, covered in skin so black it absorbs what little light penetrates The Nox. Hollow hounds hunt by sensing body heat and vibration, tracking prey through the absolute darkness with terrible precision. They're pack hunters—where one appears, others are circling.

The name comes from their bodies. Hollow hounds seem partially empty, their flesh loose on their frames, their movements suggesting internal cavities where organs should be. When killed, their bodies collapse into something like deflated skins. What animates them isn't muscle and bone in any normal sense.

Hollow hounds don't eat prey. They drag victims into the deepest dark and leave them there. Whether this serves some purpose or is simply behavior without function, no one knows.

**The Stalking**

Not a creature—an event. Those who enter The Nox alone sometimes become aware that something is following them. Not a hollow hound, not any visible predator—just presence. Footsteps that echo their own. Breathing that doesn't match theirs. The certainty that if they turn around, something will be there.

The Stalking never attacks. It doesn't need to. Victims fleeing The Stalking stumble into hollow hounds, fall from ravines, or simply run until the darkness takes them. The Stalking is patient. It can follow for days. No one has survived long enough to discover what happens if you stop running.

**The Fade**

People who vanish in The Nox don't always stay gone. Sometimes, years later, they reappear—but changed. The Fade are human-shaped absences, silhouettes where light refuses to go. They don't speak, don't respond to their names, don't seem to recognize the people they once knew. They simply walk, following paths that lead back into The Nox.

The Fade aren't aggressive. They can be touched—their surface feels like cold air, like the moment before a void—but they don't react. If blocked from their path, they'll wait indefinitely. If released, they continue walking.

Following a Fade into The Nox has been tried exactly once. No one returned.

#### Why The Nox Exists

Unknown.

The Nox doesn't correspond to any planar boundary, leyline intersection, or magical event in recorded history. It isn't growing—surveys a century apart showed no expansion. It isn't shrinking. It simply *is*, as if darkness itself decided to pool in one place and stay.

Theories exist:
- A god died here, and The Nox is the shadow it left behind
- The Nox is a wound in reality, a place where Malstaris bleeds through
- An ancient ritual went wrong, anchoring darkness to the land permanently
- The Nox is alive—a single massive entity pretending to be geography

None of these theories have supporting evidence. The Nox resists investigation more effectively than any military fortification.

#### Entry and Exit

The Nox has no fixed boundary. The hills rise gradually from Eberri Ygonzi's forest floor, and the darkness thickens in the same way—incrementally, imperceptibly, until suddenly you're in it. Woodsmen claim they can feel the transition, a pressure in the chest, a dampening of sound, but by the time the feeling is distinct, you've already crossed.

Exit is harder. The Nox doesn't keep people in through physical barriers—it keeps them in through disorientation. In the darkness, all directions feel the same. People walk in circles without knowing it. They walk deeper when trying to walk out.

The only reliable exit method: maintain continuous physical contact with a fixed marker and follow it backward. Rope anchored outside The Nox works. A line of stones works. Memory does not work—the darkness interferes with spatial reasoning in ways that defeat even experienced navigators.

#### Those Who Enter

No one enters The Nox intentionally. Those who end up there arrived by accident—lost in Eberri Ygonzi, fleeing something worse, or simply unlucky enough to miss the signs.

A few have survived to describe it:
- A hunter who tied herself to a tree and waited for dawn (dawn doesn't come inside The Nox, but it comes outside, and she was near enough the edge to feel the difference)
- A scholar's expedition that entered as fifteen and exited as three, with none able to explain what happened to the rest
- A criminal who emerged two years after entering, unable to account for the time and showing signs of the Fade that eventually stabilized

Their reports agree on the key points: the darkness is absolute, it moves with intention, and staying too long has consequences beyond death. They disagree on details—one describes the darkness as warm, another as freezing, a third as having no temperature at all. The Nox may affect different people differently, or their experiences may have been too traumatic to remember accurately.

#### No Reason to Go

The Nox contains nothing worth retrieving. No valuable resources grow there. No ruins hide ancient treasures. No mysteries warrant the risk of investigation. The Nox exists to be avoided, full stop.

If you find yourself approaching The Nox—if the light begins to fail without explanation, if sound begins to dampen, if the forest feels suddenly heavier—turn back. Don't investigate. Don't push forward to see how far it extends. Just leave.

The darkness doesn't negotiate. It doesn't give second chances. It simply takes.

#### Hooks

- **A Fade is walking.** Someone recognized as a woodsman who vanished in The Nox seven years ago has been spotted walking through farmland, heading steadily toward the forest. His family wants to stop him, talk to him, understand what happened. But he won't stop walking, and if they can't reach him before he enters the forest, they want to follow. They're hiring.

- **Something came out.** A hollow hound has been found dead outside The Nox—the first time one has ever been seen beyond its borders. Scholars are offering significant sums for the carcass, but getting it to them means transporting a hollow hound corpse through Eberri Ygonzi. And the question remains: what drove it out?

- **The expedition's survivor.** The scholar's expedition that lost twelve people had one member who kept a journal. The journal was recovered; the scholar wasn't. The journal describes something in The Nox—not the darkness or the hounds, but something else, something at the center. Something that was watching. The scholar's estate wants the journal interpreted, and if possible, they want to know if the scholar could still be alive.

- **The light that worked.** A dying priest claims that holy light from Celestia penetrates The Nox where other light fails. No one has tested this claim. No one wants to test it. But if it's true, it would be the first vulnerability The Nox has ever shown—and the implications for what The Nox actually is would be significant.

### The White Wastes

#### River Yuforhi

River of euphoria-inducing substance, most intense during the hottest part of the year. Runs through the White Wastes, so impossible to have long term settlement. However, people will meet at Ay'Nbhad to celebrate for a week straight once every year.

The substance also makes pain feel good if you have enough of it, which can result in horrible deaths.

#### Gino's Crypt

A lone crypt in a large wasteland of rot and death. This is where Gino the Terrible is chained. His curse spreads to all the surrounding land, located in the White Wastes north of the plains of wycendeula and south of the Caffas Mountains.

### Tormlek Lake

Tags: lake, geography

A shallow, mist-shrouded lake on the western edge of Fylvrae Sylvrym, where the forest gives way to coastal scrubland south of the Bay of Wolves. The lake sits in a natural depression that floods seasonally, expanding and contracting with the rains.

#### Geography

Tormlek Lake is broad but shallow—perhaps six miles across at its widest, but rarely more than fifteen feet deep even in the central basin. The bottom is soft mud accumulated over millennia, treacherous for wading and impossible for anchoring. Reeds and marsh grasses ring the shores, extending far into the water in shallower sections.

The lake is fed by several small streams draining the surrounding forest and by direct rainfall. A single outlet flows southwest toward the coast, though in dry seasons the lake can become entirely landlocked when evaporation exceeds inflow.

Morning mist rises from the lake's surface nearly year-round, obscuring visibility across the water. The mist typically burns off by midday in summer but can persist all day in autumn and winter. This creates a landscape of shifting gray obscurity, where sounds carry strangely and distances become difficult to judge.

#### Character

Tormlek Lake exists in a transitional zone between deep forest and coastal scrub. The ulvsjael don't claim it as core territory—the open terrain and shallow water don't suit their hunting tactics—but they do patrol its edges. The lake is safer than the forest interior but not safe.

The shallowness and soft bottom make the lake useless for boats of any size. The mud is thick enough to trap waders who venture too far from shore. The mist makes navigation difficult even for those staying on land. Tormlek Lake is less actively dangerous than other features in this region, but it's not welcoming.

Wildlife is more abundant here than in the deep forest. Waterfowl nest in the reeds; fish are plentiful in the clearer channels; frogs and turtles populate the shallows. For travelers who need food, the lake offers options—assuming they can harvest quickly and move on before attracting attention.

#### For Travelers

Tormlek Lake offers a potential stopover for those traveling the coastal route around Fylvrae Sylvrym. The southern shore, where the forest thins into scrubland, is the safest approach. Don't attempt to cross the lake directly—the soft bottom will trap you, and the mist will disorient you.

Fresh water is readily available but should be filtered; the shallow lake accumulates sediment and organic matter. Game is plentiful along the shores. Stay out of the mist if possible—ulvsjael can navigate by scent, and you can't.

The outlet stream provides a landmark for navigation. Follow it southwest to reach the coast south of the Bay of Wolves.

### Trauma Lake

Tags: lake, geography, dangerous, wycendeula

A large lake on the eastern edge of Eberri Ygonzi, where the forest gives way to the approaches of Kama Sa'malina. Trauma Lake is not part of the greater lake district—it's older, deeper, and wrong in ways that Kama Sa'malina's gilthrain-infested waters are not.

The name is a warning.

#### Geography

Trauma Lake covers roughly twelve square miles, making it one of the largest single bodies of water in the region. The shores are rocky on the west (where the lake meets the forest edge) and marshy on the east (where it bleeds into Kama Sa'malina's wetlands). The water is dark—not murky, but deep enough that light disappears a few feet below the surface.

The lake has no visible inlet or outlet. Water levels remain constant regardless of season or rainfall. This should be impossible—evaporation alone should shrink it over time—but Trauma Lake doesn't follow the rules that govern normal hydrology.

#### What Happens Here

People who spend time near Trauma Lake experience their worst memories.

Not hallucinations. Not visions. The actual memories, forced to the surface with perfect clarity—every detail preserved, every emotion fresh. Childhood terrors. Losses. Betrayals. The things you've spent years learning to live with come back as if they happened yesterday.

Proximity to the water intensifies the effect. Standing on the shore produces discomfort—intrusive thoughts, unwanted recollections. Touching the water triggers full immersion in a specific traumatic memory. Swimming in it—rare, given the lake's reputation—causes victims to relive trauma after trauma until they drown or are pulled out.

The effect isn't magical in any conventional sense. Divination reveals nothing unusual about the water. Wards against mental intrusion don't help. Whatever Trauma Lake does, it operates outside the frameworks scholars use to understand supernatural phenomena.

#### The Lake's Nature

Theories about Trauma Lake:

**The Sponge**: The lake absorbs traumatic experiences from those nearby, then radiates them back. It's accumulated centuries of suffering and now broadcasts it constantly.

**The Mirror**: The lake doesn't create the experiences—it reflects what's already in the victim. Everyone carries trauma; the lake simply removes the defenses that keep it buried.

**The Predator**: Something lives in the lake (or is the lake) and feeds on psychological pain. The memory-forcing is hunting behavior, tenderizing prey before consumption.

**The Wound**: Trauma Lake is damage to reality itself—a place where something broke, and the breaking radiates outward through the people who come near it.

No theory has been proven. The lake resists investigation because investigators can rarely function well enough to study it.

#### Documented Effects

**Proximity (within sight of water)**
- Intrusive thoughts
- General unease
- Difficulty concentrating
- Mild depressive symptoms

**Shore contact (within a few feet)**
- Vivid recollection of specific negative experiences
- Emotional dysregulation
- Paranoia
- Compulsion to approach the water

**Water contact**
- Full immersion in traumatic memory
- Loss of awareness of present surroundings
- Physical responses matching the remembered trauma (elevated heart rate, sweating, trembling)
- Drowning risk if contact continues

**Prolonged exposure**
- Permanent psychological damage
- Inability to distinguish past from present
- In extreme cases, catatonia

Recovery from mild exposure takes hours. Recovery from water contact can take weeks. Some people never fully recover—they remain trapped in loops of memory that no treatment has broken.

#### The Thing in the Water

Some survivors report seeing something in the lake. Not clearly—Trauma Lake's darkness obscures details—but shapes moving in the depths. Large shapes. Slow-moving. Watching.

Whether this is real or an artifact of the lake's psychological effects is debated. The fact that multiple survivors describe similar shapes (elongated, sinuous, roughly humanoid) suggests either a genuine entity or a shared hallucination the lake induces.

If something lives in Trauma Lake, no one has successfully identified it. Fishing produces nothing—no fish survive in the water. Attempts to sound the lake's depth have produced inconsistent results, with some measurements suggesting the bottom is hundreds of feet down and others suggesting it's much, much farther.

#### Why Anyone Goes Near

They don't, if they can avoid it. Trauma Lake sits in a region people already avoid for other reasons. The few who encounter it are usually lost travelers, and they learn quickly to leave.

Some seek the lake intentionally. Scholars, obviously—Trauma Lake represents a genuine mystery, and certain researchers consider psychological damage an acceptable cost for understanding. More disturbing: some people come to the lake deliberately, seeking their worst memories. Guilt-ridden, grieving, or simply self-destructive, they use the lake to punish themselves in ways no other method can match.

The lake has been used for torture. Victims forced to the water's edge, held there until the memories break them. It's more effective than physical pain and leaves no marks. The practice is outlawed everywhere civilized, but Wycendeula isn't civilized.

#### Hooks

- **The researcher's offer.** A scholar is mounting an expedition to Trauma Lake with experimental protections—mental wards, memory-dampening potions, carefully planned time limits. She needs guards who can function near the water. Payment is excellent. The survival rate for previous expeditions is not mentioned.

- **The survivor's request.** Someone emerged from Trauma Lake after extended exposure—unusual enough to warrant attention. They're functional, mostly, but they claim they saw something at the bottom. Something that spoke to them. They want to go back, and they want company.

- **The murderer's justice.** A criminal has escaped conventional punishment by fleeing into the wilderness. The victims' families are offering a bounty, but they want the criminal brought to Trauma Lake, not to a court. They want justice the lake's way. Is this acceptable? Is it even justice?

- **The lake is growing.** Reports suggest Trauma Lake's eastern shore is expanding into Kama Sa'malina's territory. If true, the lake is now doing something it has never done in recorded history. What changed, and what happens when two dangerous regions begin to overlap?

### Wer Azenzi

Tags: lake, geography, riin, eyendra, wycendeula

A cluster of small lakes in northern Eyendra, scattered through the forest between Lean D'Riin and the coast. Unlike the lakes of Kama Sa'malina far to the south, Wer Azenzi's waters are tied to the Riin—the ancient civilization that merged with the Eyendra forest two thousand years ago. The lakes are where the Riin presence pools most densely, and that presence makes itself felt.

The name is Riin. No one knows exactly what it means anymore—possibly "gathering waters" or "waters that hold." The translation hardly matters. What matters is that these lakes are not entirely natural, and they are not entirely empty.

#### Geography

Wer Azenzi comprises roughly two dozen lakes scattered across a thirty-mile stretch of Eyendra's interior, beginning about forty miles inland from Zor and extending deeper toward Lean D'Riin. The lakes vary from small ponds to bodies covering several acres, connected by streams and marshy ground.

The terrain is dense boreal forest—old growth that has never been cut, canopy thick enough to block most direct sunlight. The lakes create clearings in the canopy, pockets where sky is visible and light reaches the ground. These clearings should be welcoming. Instead, they feel exposed. Watched.

#### The Riin Connection

The Riin built settlements throughout what is now Eyendra, and many of those settlements stood near the Wer Azenzi lakes. When the Riin merged with the forest, their presence didn't distribute evenly—it concentrated in certain places. The lakes are among the densest concentrations.

This means the Riin are more *present* at Wer Azenzi than elsewhere in Eyendra. Not conscious. Not communicating. Just... there, in a way that can be felt. Standing at the shore of a Wer Azenzi lake produces a sensation of proximity—not being alone, even when you are. The feeling intensifies near certain lakes and at certain times, following patterns no one has successfully mapped.

#### What the Lakes Do

The lakes exhibit phenomena consistent with Riin presence but distinct from anything else in Eyendra.

**The showing**: The lakes occasionally display images on their surfaces—not reflections of what's present, but scenes from elsewhere. Scholars believe these are glimpses of Riin life, moments from the civilization's past somehow imprinted on the water. The images are fragmentary, silent, and impossible to summon deliberately. They simply appear, persist for minutes or hours, and fade.

**The knowing**: People who linger near Wer Azenzi sometimes acquire knowledge they shouldn't have—phrases in a dead language, skills they never learned, awareness of places they've never visited. The knowledge is incomplete and often unusable, but it's clearly Riin in origin. Some researchers have deliberately sought this effect, hoping to reconstruct lost Riin culture. Results have been mixed; the knowledge comes randomly if at all, and extended exposure carries risks.

**The pull**: Certain individuals feel drawn to specific lakes—compelled to approach, to touch the water, to stay. This pull correlates with nothing scholars have identified; it affects some people and not others, varies in intensity, and sometimes reverses (pushing people away instead of drawing them in). The dragon's rules prohibit following the pull, but enforcement is difficult in the forest's interior.

#### Dangers

Wer Azenzi is dangerous in ways different from Kama Sa'malina's predators or Trauma Lake's psychological assault.

The danger is *absorption*. People who spend too much time at Wer Azenzi begin to lose themselves. Not dramatically—no sudden transformations or violent deaths. The change is gradual. Interests shift. Preferences change. Memories blur. The victim begins to feel less like themselves and more like... something else. Something older. Something distributed.

Extreme cases result in people walking into the lakes and not coming out. Not drowning—just walking in, going under, and being gone. What happens to them is unknown. Possibly they complete a process the Riin began. Possibly they simply die. The dragon doesn't permit investigation.

#### The Dragon's Rules

Ezra Olkanis includes Wer Azenzi in her territorial prohibitions, but the rules here are different from elsewhere in Eyendra. Zor's people are permitted limited access—approaching the lakes, drawing water, even camping nearby—but with restrictions:

- No contact with the water beyond necessity
- No more than three days in the lake region at a time
- Immediate departure if symptoms of absorption appear
- No attempts to communicate with whatever the lakes contain

These rules are enforced through the same mechanisms as other pact terms: violators tend to vanish, and the dragon's involvement is assumed but never proven.

#### Hooks

- **The showing keeps recurring.** A specific lake has been displaying the same image repeatedly—a Riin figure doing something with their hands, a gesture that might be ritual or might be communication. A scholar believes this is intentional, that the Riin (or what remains of them) are trying to convey something. She needs assistance documenting the image and possibly attempting response.

- **Someone came back changed.** A hunter who spent too long at Wer Azenzi has returned to Zor speaking fluent Riin—a language no living person knows. He doesn't remember learning it. He doesn't remember much of anything clearly. But he can read the Archive documents that have baffled scholars for centuries, and what he's reading is disturbing him.

- **The pull has victims.** Multiple people from Zor have gone missing after reporting being drawn toward a specific Wer Azenzi lake. Their families want answers, but investigating means entering the lake region and possibly experiencing the pull firsthand. The council is debating whether to act and how.

### Zor

Tags: city, state, nation, wycendeula, eyendra

Zor is the only permanent settlement in the Eyendra forest—a city-state of roughly 15,000 souls perched on the western shore of Moornik Bay, facing outward toward the sea and deliberately turning its back on the forest that surrounds it on three sides.

The city exists because a dragon permits it. Eight centuries of survival have taught Zor's people that some bargains, however strange, are worth keeping.

#### Geography and Position

Zor occupies a rocky promontory jutting into Moornik Bay, with the Eyendra forest pressing close on all landward sides. The position is defensible—cliffs to the east, walls to the west—but defense against conventional enemies has never been Zor's concern. The walls face the forest.

The harbor is modest but well-protected, capable of handling deep-water vessels that make the journey from Wycendeula's other coastal settlements. Most visitors arrive by sea. The land approaches are technically possible but require crossing the coastal fringe of Eyendra, and few outsiders are willing to do so.

The city itself is compact, built primarily of stone quarried from the coastal cliffs rather than timber from the forest. Early Zor learned that lesson—buildings made from Eyendra wood sometimes *moved*, their beams shifting in ways that structural stress couldn't explain. Now wood is imported or taken only from the permitted extraction zones, and builders treat it with salt and iron to be safe.

#### The Dragon Pact

Zor's existence is predicated on an agreement with Ezra Olkanis, the ancient dragon who dwells in the Eyendra interior. The pact predates the current city—the original agreement was made with a fishing village that grew into Zor over eight centuries.

**The terms:**

**Zor must not disturb the interior.** The dragon's primary demand. Certain ruins are forbidden. Certain lakes—particularly in the Wer Azenzi region—must never be approached. Certain paths must not be walked. The boundaries shift over decades; the dragon occasionally sends word through means the council does not discuss publicly. Zor obeys without question.

**Zor must report what it observes.** Changes in the forest. Unusual activity. Strangers asking questions about the interior. The dragon wants to know what happens at her borders. Zor's Watchers maintain constant observation and send reports through channels established centuries ago.

**Zor may take from the forest's edge.** The coastal fringe, roughly twenty miles deep, is open for extraction. Timber, herbs, game, freshwater—all permitted. Beyond that invisible boundary, permission ends.

**The dragon may demand service.** Rarely invoked, but part of the pact: when the dragon requires something, Zor provides it. This has meant guides, supplies, specific artifacts, and occasionally people with particular skills. Those summoned to the interior usually return. Usually.

**In exchange, Zor survives.** Whether the dragon actively protects the city or merely refrains from destroying it is a theological debate in Zor. Pragmatists note the distinction is academic—eight centuries of survival speak for themselves.

Every generation, the ruling council formally reaffirms the pact. The dragon has not appeared in person for over two centuries, but no one assumes this means she has forgotten.

#### The Telling

The Telling is Zor's central civic ritual—a public recitation of what the city knows about the Riin, the forest, and why both must be respected. The dragon did not demand this; Zor developed it on their own, a way of ensuring that every citizen understands the dangers that surround them.

The Telling occurs on specific calendar days throughout the year, with the largest at midsummer lasting three full days. Children learn the stories before they learn to fish. Participation is expected, though not legally mandatory—social pressure handles enforcement.

The Telling includes:
- **The Warnings**: What happens to those who cross the boundaries. Specific cases, specific fates. This is the most important part.
- **The Signs**: How to recognize when the forest is responding to your presence. What to do if it does.
- **The Riin Stories**: What little is known about the civilization that became the forest—fragments from the Archive, theories from scholars, guesses that have hardened into tradition.
- **The Pact**: How Zor came to exist under the dragon's eye, and what the arrangement requires.

The Telling serves a practical purpose: survival education disguised as civic ritual. But over eight centuries, it has become something more—the core of Zor's identity, the thing that makes them different from every other city in Wycendeula. They live beside a forest that was once people, under the eye of an ancient dragon, and they've built a culture around not forgetting that fact.

#### The Archive

Zor maintains an Archive of Riin materials—documents, artifacts, and records recovered over centuries from the coastal fringe. The collection exists partly from scholarly interest, partly from practical necessity: understanding the Riin might help Zor survive them.

The Archive is housed in a fortified building near the council hall, maintained by a small order of scholars. They've pieced together fragments over generations—a rough vocabulary, some grammatical structures, guesses at historical events—but the full meaning of most documents remains opaque. The Riin language died with the Riin, and what remains are puzzles without solutions.

Some materials are restricted. Not because the council fears dangerous knowledge, but because certain artifacts have demonstrated... effects. Documents that induce headaches when read too long. Objects that feel warm in ways that have nothing to do with temperature. The Archive learned caution through experience.

Outside scholars occasionally pay significant sums to access the collection. The Archive permits this selectively—knowledge about the Riin is one of Zor's few valuable exports.

#### Governance

Zor is ruled by a hereditary council—five families whose ancestors negotiated the original pact with Ezra Olkanis. Power rotates among the families on a complex schedule, with one family holding the Speakership (primary executive authority) for fifteen years before passing it to the next.

The system is stable but rigid. The pact families derive legitimacy from their role in maintaining the dragon bargain; challenging them means challenging the arrangement that keeps Zor alive. Reform movements exist but rarely gain traction—most citizens are pragmatic enough to prefer a functioning tyranny to an exciting collapse.

The current Speaker is **Maera Theln**, third of her name, a practical woman in her sixties who has held the position for eleven years. She is known for cautious competence rather than vision—exactly what Zor values.

Below the council, governance is handled by guilds: the Foresters' Guild (managing extraction rights), the Fishers' Guild (controlling the harbor), the Shipwrights' Guild, the Archive scholars, and various lesser organizations. The guilds have significant autonomy in their domains but defer to the council on anything touching the pact.

#### Economy

Zor's economy is maritime and extractive. The city produces little that requires land beyond the coastal fringe, and imports heavily from other Wycendeula settlements.

**Exports:**
- **Eyendra timber**: The trees of the coastal fringe grow dense and straight, prized for shipbuilding. Zor's foresters harvest carefully within pact boundaries and sell to shipyards across Wycendeula.
- **Herbs and medicinals**: The forest's edge produces plants found nowhere else—some enhanced by proximity to whatever the forest has become. Zor's herbalists process and sell these, though they don't advertise the source.
- **Preserved fish**: Moornik Bay is rich in cold-water species. Zor's fisheries are productive, and salted or smoked fish travels well.
- **Knowledge**: Scholars occasionally pay significant sums to access the Archive or consult with Zor's experts on Riin history.

**Imports:**
- Grain (the coastal fringe doesn't support agriculture)
- Metal goods (no mining within pact boundaries)
- Luxury items (Zor's isolation limits local craft)
- Lumber from outside Eyendra (for buildings where Eyendra wood might be... unreliable)

Trade happens by sea. Overland routes through the forest are theoretically possible but rarely used—the journey is uncomfortable even within the coastal fringe, and the risk of accidentally crossing boundaries deters most merchants.

#### Culture

Zor's people are practical, superstitious, and acutely aware of their precarious position. Optimism is considered naive; fatalism is closer to the norm. The city has survived eight centuries through caution and compliance, and its culture reflects that.

**Relationship with the forest**: Complex. Zor depends on the coastal fringe for timber, herbs, and game, but no one forgets what lies deeper. Children are raised on Riin stories not as entertainment but as warnings. The forest is respected the way one respects a sleeping predator—you move quietly and hope it doesn't wake.

**Relationship with the dragon**: Even more complex. Ezra Olkanis is not worshipped, exactly, but she is acknowledged in ways that blur the line. Prayers before entering the forest invoke her patience. Oaths are sworn on her name. When something goes well, people say the dragon permitted it; when something goes wrong, people check whether anyone broke the pact.

**Outsiders**: Welcomed cautiously. Zor trades with the outside world and values contact, but visitors who ask too many questions about the interior make people nervous. The council maintains a quiet list of foreigners who have expressed interest in reaching the dragon or exploring the ruins—such people tend to find their supplies running short and their ship departures suddenly available.

#### Notable Locations

##### The Council Hall
The heart of Zor's government, a stone building older than the current city walls. The original pact was supposedly affirmed here, though the building has been rebuilt twice. The Hall contains the formal archive of pact records, the speaker's chambers, and the Recitation Court where major Tellings are conducted.

##### The Archive
A fortified structure housing Riin documents and artifacts. Access is restricted; casual visitors are turned away. Serious scholars can petition for limited access, but the council is selective about who gets to study the materials.

##### The Forester's Gate
The only official exit from the city into the forest, controlled by the Foresters' Guild. All extraction expeditions depart and return through the Gate, where they're logged, inspected, and (quietly) checked for signs of corruption or unauthorized contact.

##### The Watchmount
A tower on the city's western wall, the highest point in Zor. The Watchers—a small civic order—maintain continuous observation of the forest edge. They're looking for signs of change: paths that weren't there yesterday, trees that have moved, the subtle wrongness that precedes forest attention. When they see something, the Forester's Guild adjusts boundaries accordingly.

##### The Harbormeet
The commercial district along the waterfront, where trade happens and foreigners are permitted. Inns, taverns, chandlers, and fish markets cluster here. The Harbormeet is the most "normal" part of Zor—the place where the city's isolation is least apparent and the dragon is rarely mentioned.

#### Threats and Tensions

**The Rationalists**: A faction within Zor's merchant class that believes the dragon is dead, gone, or exaggerated. They advocate exploring the interior, exploiting the forest more aggressively, and ending the Telling as superstition. They have never held power, but their numbers grow when trade is poor.

**The Interior Dreams**: People in Zor sometimes dream of the forest—of walking paths they've never seen, of faces that feel familiar but aren't. Most recover. Some don't. The Archive scholars track these incidents, looking for patterns. They haven't found any yet, but the frequency seems to be increasing.

**Resource Pressure**: Zor's population has grown, but the extraction zones haven't. Demand for timber and herbs is outpacing what the coastal fringe can sustainably provide. Eventually, someone will cross a boundary, deliberately or not. What happens then is unclear.

**The Archive's Secrets**: The restricted sections of the Archive may contain knowledge that shouldn't be recovered—Riin techniques, reasons for their choice, possibly even methods to reverse the merger or communicate with what they became. Some scholars believe this knowledge should be destroyed. Others believe it's why the dragon wants it preserved.

## Venalthier

### Geography

Venalthier is the frozen polar region occupying the extreme southwest of Upoceax. This is a land of white cliffs, glacial ice, and bitter cold—a world apart from the forests and plains of the main continent. Roughly 1,100 miles east to west and 650 miles north to south, Venalthier is larger than many nations yet supports fewer than a thousand permanent residents.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eceraen Mountains (running east-west) separate Venalthier from Wycendeula; Tundra Oblivio lies between the mountains and the Whitewalls
- **East**: The Sea of Daggers and its extension, the Frozen Sea; the impossible boundary with Eyendra forest
- **South**: Open polar ocean; the Akratian Plateau extends toward the unexplored pole
- **West**: Dismar Deep, the southwestern ocean; the Crystal Coast and Scepter Mountains

#### Major Regions

##### Northern Transition

**Tundra Oblivio**: The windswept wasteland between the Eceraen Mountains and the Whitewall barrier. Contains the Blerian Hills and the settlement of Morya (~200 souls surviving on Nabuhe-supplied Frostfire).

**The Whitewalls**: The great ice cliffs marking Venalthier's northern edge:
- **West Whitewall**: Pure glacier, constantly calving into the Dismar Deep
- **The Face**: Mysterious cliff formation with a face-like profile, containing the warm Eye pool
- **East Whitewall**: Ice over rock, home to the Nabuhe dwarves and their Frostfire mines

##### Interior Ice Plains

**Morelous**: The western interior plain, punctuated by rocky "teeth" that provide navigation and shelter. Primary overland route between East Whitewall and the Scepter Mountains.

**Pale Death**: The central-eastern plain of featureless white, notorious for claiming travelers. Its eastern edge meets the impossible boundary of Eyendra forest, where polar conditions end and living boreal forest begins instantly.

**Ekri Towers**: Twin black spires of unknown origin rising from the ice between Morelous and Selengreyb—the only structures in Venalthier's interior.

##### Southern Plateaus

**Selengreyb Plateau**: The elevated heart of Venalthier at 5,000-6,000 feet, source of the katabatic winds that scour the interior. Contains a mysterious central depression with anomalous properties.

**West Selengreyb**: The brutal transition slope where plateau winds accelerate to maximum velocity—the most dangerous leg of east-west travel.

**Akratian Plateau**: The southernmost landmass, extending toward the polar ice cap. Gateway to the unreached southern pole, known for the phenomenon of singing ice.

##### Coastal Features

**Crystal Coast**: Northwestern shoreline where intricate ice formations refract polar light into spectacular displays. Richest marine ecosystem in Venalthier.

**Scepter Mountains**: Western coastal range with the only viable landing points. Contains the fjords (Deepest Reach, Shatter Bay, Ghostwater) and mountain passes (Coldgate, Scepter Gap) that connect Venalthier to the outside world.

#### Climate

Venalthier experiences polar conditions year-round:
- **Temperatures**: -20°C to -60°C depending on region and season
- **Wind**: Persistent katabatic flows from Selengreyb, 30-60 mph constant, gusting to 100+
- **Polar Night**: 3 months of complete darkness in the south; proportionally less further north
- **Polar Day**: Corresponding months of continuous dim light

### Political Climate

Venalthier has no nations, no governments, no territorial claims. The only organized presence is the Nabuhe dwarf clan in East Whitewall, who control the Frostfire mines and thereby control access to the only reliable heat source in the region.

The Nabuhe don't rule Venalthier—they simply survive it better than anyone else. Their monopoly on Frostfire gives them power without requiring them to exercise it; anyone who wants to live in Venalthier needs Frostfire, and the Nabuhe set the terms.

Beyond the Nabuhe territory, Venalthier is lawless in the truest sense. No authorities, no enforcement, no structure. Survival is the only law, and the ice enforces it impartially.

### What Makes It Interesting

**Ancient Powers**: Venalthier contains layers of history most of Alaria has forgotten:
- **The Face (Velkoreth)**: A dead titan whose body provides the Frostfire that makes life possible here. Its Eye grants access to memories spanning epochs.
- **Ekri Towers**: Riin ruins containing Ekri herself—a woman who refused to merge with her people's collective consciousness, still conscious after 2,000 years.
- **The Lunar Fragment**: Debris from the lost third moon buried under Selengreyb, containing concentrated planar resonance.
- **Keth-Vorun**: A pre-primordial entity imprisoned at the pole, whose containment creates Venalthier's climate.

**Resources**: Frostfire (crystallized titan life-force), glassworm organs (alchemical value), Crystal Coast ice (optical properties), lunar fragment material (planar resonance), and Velkoreth's memories (accessed through the Eye) all offer power to those who can survive harvesting them.

**The Eyendra Boundary**: Where Riin magic holds polar conditions at bay, creating an instant transition from ice to living forest. The Riin collective maintains this boundary; understanding how could revolutionize climate magic.

### What Will Go Wrong

**Frostfire Depletion**: The Frostfire supply is finite—it's Velkoreth's remaining life force. When it runs out, the titan truly dies, the Nabuhe lose their monopoly, and the economic structure of Venalthier collapses.

**Lunar Fragment Excavation**: Eventually, someone with enough resources will attempt to reach the buried moon fragment. The Riin tried two thousand years ago and the survivors founded Eyendra's merger. Whatever they learned there drove an entire civilization to dissolve itself.

**Keth-Vorun Communication**: The entity at the pole has been trying to communicate for millions of years. If someone successfully translates its language, they might share that comprehension—and Keth-Vorun can sense minds that understand it.

**Ekri's Release**: Two thousand years of isolation may have changed Ekri. If someone finds a way to unseal her tower, what emerges may not be what went in.

**Glassworm Expansion**: The glassworms are confined to Pale Death because prey is scarce elsewhere. If populations in Morelous or the Tundra grow, the worms will follow. They're apex predators with no natural enemies.

### Akratian Plateau

Tags: plateau, ice, geography

The southernmost landmass of Venalthier—a windswept plateau extending toward the polar ice cap, where the boundary between land and permanent sea ice becomes impossible to determine. The Akratian Plateau represents the end of the world in the most literal sense: beyond it lies only the frozen ocean and the pole itself.

#### Geography

The Akratian Plateau rises south of the Selengreyb Plateau, separated by a broad glacial valley. It extends roughly 200 miles east to west and at least 150 miles north to south—"at least" because no one has mapped its southern extent. At some point, the land ice merges with the sea ice, and the distinction becomes meaningless.

Elevation averages 4,000-5,000 feet, lower than Selengreyb but still punishingly high. The surface is smoother than the northern plateau, with fewer undulations and less visible variation. The ice here is older, more compressed, bluer in color. In places, it's nearly transparent, revealing dark rock hundreds of feet below.

The plateau's edges are marked by ice cliffs where glaciers calve into the surrounding sea—extensions of the Whitewall system that wraps around Venalthier's coast. These southern cliffs are lower and less dramatic than the northern Whitewalls, but they extend for hundreds of miles in both directions.

#### The Polar Approach

The Akratian Plateau is the gateway to Alaria's southern pole—or would be, if reaching the pole were possible.

The plateau gradually merges with the polar ice sheet, a transition zone of perhaps 100 miles where land-based ice and sea-based ice become indistinguishable. Beyond that transition, the polar ice cap extends to the geographic pole itself, an additional 500+ miles of frozen ocean that no expedition has successfully crossed.

Several attempts have been made. All have failed. The furthest known penetration reached approximately 200 miles onto the sea ice before being forced to turn back by conditions that made continued travel impossible. What those conditions were, the survivors couldn't fully articulate—something about the ice itself becoming wrong, the compass spinning uselessly, time seeming to stretch and compress unpredictably.

The pole remains unconquered, its nature unknown. Some scholars theorize it's simply more ice extending to a mathematical point. Others believe something exists at the pole—something that doesn't want to be found.

#### Conditions

The Akratian Plateau experiences the most extreme cold in Alaria:

**Temperature**: Averaging -50°C to -60°C, with recorded extremes approaching -80°C during polar night. These are temperatures where steel becomes brittle, where exposed flesh freezes in seconds, where survival is measured in minutes rather than hours.

**Light**: The plateau experiences true polar night—complete 24-hour darkness—for approximately three months per year. During this period, the only illumination comes from stars, moons, and occasional auroral displays. The polar day provides corresponding months of continuous dim light, though the sun barely clears the horizon.

**Isolation**: The Akratian Plateau is further from human habitation than anywhere else in the known world. The nearest settlement (the Nabuhe in East Whitewall) is over 300 miles of hostile terrain away. No help exists; no rescue is possible.

#### Why Anyone Goes

Despite the conditions, expeditions occasionally attempt the Akratian Plateau. Their reasons vary:

**Polar Conquest**: Some are driven by the simple desire to reach the pole—to stand at the bottom of the world and return to tell of it. None have succeeded, but the attempts continue.

**Scientific Study**: Scholars of climate, geology, and planar physics find the extreme conditions valuable for research. The ice cores from Akratian contain records of Alaria's climate stretching back hundreds of thousands of years.

**Spiritual Quest**: Certain religious traditions hold that the poles are points of connection between the material plane and something else—that standing at the world's axis provides insight unavailable elsewhere. Whether this is true, none can say; those who've gone furthest report experiences that resist description.

**Rumors**: Whispers persist of something at the pole—a structure, a presence, an artifact. The details vary wildly and none can be verified. But the rumors are old, appearing in texts predating any known expedition, suggesting they come from a source other than failed attempts.

#### The Ice Singers

One phenomenon is consistently reported by Akratian expeditions: the ice sings.

Not metaphorically. The ice produces sounds—tones that rise and fall, harmonics that shift and layer, something that resembles music but follows no recognizable pattern. The singing is loudest during the coldest periods and disappears entirely during warmer spells. It seems to emanate from deep within the glacier, from far to the south.

The singing is a voice. Specifically, it's the voice of Keth-Vorun, a primordial entity that was imprisoned at the southern pole before the current age began.

Keth-Vorun predates the God War, the titans, possibly the primordials themselves. The fragmentary records that mention it describe something that existed before the current arrangement of planes—a consciousness from an earlier attempt at creation that went wrong. The beings who became the primordials didn't destroy Keth-Vorun; they couldn't. Instead, they bound it at the axis of the world and froze it there, using the planet's rotation to power a containment that has held for epochs.

The ice cap isn't natural. It exists because Keth-Vorun is cold, profoundly cold, in ways that transcend temperature. Its prison leaks, and that leakage creates Venalthier's climate. The polar conditions that make this continent uninhabitable are a side effect of something far worse being kept contained.

The singing is Keth-Vorun attempting to communicate. It has been attempting to communicate for millions of years. The "music" is actually a language, but the concepts it encodes are so alien that mortal minds experience them as abstract sound rather than meaning. Those who listen too long begin to parse it—and that's when the madness starts. Understanding Keth-Vorun's language means thinking in patterns incompatible with sanity.

#### What The Nabuhe Know

The Nabuhe learned about Keth-Vorun from Velkoreth's memories—the titan whose corpse is The Face. Before dying, Velkoreth witnessed the binding, epochs ago, and that memory persists in the Frostfire. Nabuhe who consume unprocessed Frostfire during certain rituals can access fragments of the titan's knowledge, including its understanding of what lies at the pole.

The Nabuhe don't go to the Akratian Plateau because they know exactly what's there. They don't share this knowledge because understanding Keth-Vorun invites its attention. The entity can sense minds that comprehend it; those who learn what it truly is become audible to something that has been trying to communicate for millions of years.

The failed polar expeditions didn't turn back because of harsh conditions. They turned back because the singing started making sense.

#### For Travelers

The Akratian Plateau is not a destination. It is a warning.

The further south you go, the more coherent the singing becomes. At a certain point—roughly 200 miles onto the polar ice—travelers begin understanding fragments. Words, concepts, fragments of meaning that shouldn't translate but do. This is the point of no return. Those who understand Keth-Vorun's language can never fully stop hearing it.

If you go:

- **Stop when you start understanding**. The moment the singing starts making sense, turn back immediately. You're already compromised; going further makes it permanent.
- **Don't talk about what you heard**. Articulating Keth-Vorun's concepts to others spreads the comprehension. Keep the fragments to yourself.
- **Expect persistent effects**. Anyone who's heard the singing clearly will dream of cold and alien geometry for the rest of their lives. This isn't madness—it's contact.
- **Accept that you'll never reach the pole**. The prison is designed to be unapproachable. The closer you get, the more effective its defenses become.

The pole is not unreachable because of physical obstacles. It's unreachable because Keth-Vorun's nature becomes more apparent as you approach, and mortal minds cannot remain coherent in proximity to what it actually is.

### Crystal Coast

Tags: coast, geography

The northwestern shoreline of Venalthier, where the Scepter Mountains descend into the Dismar Deep. The Crystal Coast takes its name from the ice formations that develop along its cliffs—intricate crystalline structures that catch the polar light and scatter it into rainbow fragments visible for miles.

#### Geography

The Crystal Coast extends roughly 100 miles from where the northern Scepter Mountains meet the sea southward to where the coast curves east toward Morelous and the interior ice plains. The shoreline is predominantly cliffs—volcanic rock topped with glacial ice—dropping 200-400 feet into dark, cold water.

Unlike the smooth ice cliffs of the Whitewalls, the Crystal Coast is jagged and irregular. The volcanic substrate creates outcrops and peninsulas that break up the shoreline, while the ice formations that grow on these features add another layer of complexity. The overall effect is a coastline that seems almost organic, like frozen waves captured mid-crash.

The water along the Crystal Coast is exceptionally deep. The seafloor drops away rapidly from the cliff base, reaching 500+ fathoms within a mile of shore. This depth brings cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface, supporting marine life that the rest of Venalthier's coast lacks.

#### The Crystals

The coast's namesake formations grow wherever spray and mist meet the cold rock:

**Structure**: The crystals are pure water ice, but their growth patterns create structures unlike normal icicles. They branch and fork repeatedly, building three-dimensional lattices that can extend 20-30 feet from the cliff face. The largest formations resemble frozen chandeliers or inverted ice trees.

**Optics**: The crystal structure refracts light with unusual efficiency. On clear days, the coast becomes a display of prismatic color—rainbow fans spreading from each major formation, overlapping and blending into effects that seem almost magical. Some observers have described seeing colors that don't exist in normal rainbows.

**Sound**: Wind passing through the crystal lattices produces tones—not the singing of the southern ice, but clear, bell-like notes that ring across the water. Sailors approaching the coast often hear it before they see it, a chiming that carries for miles in calm conditions.

**Fragility**: The crystals are structurally delicate. Heavy storms break them apart, scattering ice fragments into the sea. They regrow within weeks, never quite the same, as though the coast is constantly reinventing its appearance.

#### Wildlife

The Crystal Coast supports Venalthier's richest marine ecosystem:

**Seals**: Multiple species haul out on the rocky ledges between crystal formations. Their populations number in the thousands—by far the largest concentration of marine mammals in the region.

**Seabirds**: The cliffs provide nesting habitat for millions of birds during breeding season. The guano accumulation is thick enough to be visible as white patches from miles away.

**Fish**: The deep, cold water supports abundant fish populations. Cod, halibut, and species found nowhere else in Alaria swim these waters. The fishing is excellent for anyone who can access it.

**Whales**: Seasonal migrations bring whales past the Crystal Coast. Their songs sometimes harmonize with the wind-chimes of the ice, creating acoustic phenomena that defy rational explanation.

#### Access and Use

The Crystal Coast is theoretically the most accessible part of Venalthier:

**By Sea**: Ships can approach the coast relatively safely, anchoring in the deeper water off the cliff bases. The lack of ice floes (the deep water prevents freeze-up) makes navigation easier than elsewhere in the region.

**Fishing**: Small operations occasionally work the Crystal Coast waters, harvesting fish and seals. These are typically based from the Scepter Mountains passes, running fast trips to the coast and back before conditions deteriorate.

**Landing**: Actually getting ashore is more difficult. The cliffs lack beaches, and the rocky ledges are occupied by wildlife. Rope ascents from boats are possible but dangerous, and the crystal formations make finding stable anchor points challenging.

#### The Nabuhe and the Coast

The Nabuhe don't visit the Crystal Coast frequently, but they value its resources. Occasionally, trading parties make the journey across Morelous to collect items available nowhere else:

**Crystal Ice**: Fragments of the optical ice formations are prized for decorative and possibly magical purposes. Properly cut and polished, they retain their light-bending properties indefinitely.

**Seal Products**: Seal oil, meat, and hides are valuable in Venalthier's resource-poor environment. A successful hunting expedition can supply a settlement for months.

**Fish**: Dried and preserved, Crystal Coast fish is the closest thing to a reliable food source available in Venalthier outside of Frostfire-heated cultivation.

#### For Travelers

The Crystal Coast is one of Venalthier's few regions that rewards visitors with something other than survival:

- **Approach by sea** if possible. The overland route across Morelous is dangerous; the sea approach merely difficult.
- **Bring rope and climbing gear**. Ascending the cliffs is the only way to fully experience the crystal formations.
- **Time your visit for clear weather**. The optical displays require direct light; overcast conditions render the coast merely dramatic rather than spectacular.
- **Don't disturb the crystals**. Breaking formations to collect samples sometimes triggers chain reactions that can bring down entire structures. Harvest only fragments that have already fallen.
- **Respect the wildlife**. The seals and birds are the coast's true residents. They were here first and will be here after you leave.

The Crystal Coast is proof that Venalthier isn't entirely hostile—just mostly hostile. This small stretch of beauty exists because the conditions happened to align in ways that create wonder rather than merely death. It's worth seeing, if you can reach it.

### East Whitewall

Tags: cliffs, geography

The first major face of cliffs in Venalthier, home to the Nabuhe dwarves who have carved extensive mining operations into the frozen stone.

#### Nabuhe Dwarves

A clan of dwarves adapted to the extreme cold of Venalthier, the Nabuhe have survived in this harsh environment by mining the unique resource that makes life possible in the frozen wastes.

#### Frostfire Mines

Deep within East Whitewall, the Nabuhe mine Frostfire—a miraculous material that burns from within, emitting warmth without consuming fuel. This is the only reliable source of heat for the dwarves in the southern frozen regions, making it more valuable than gold or gems.

However, Frostfire possesses a darker property: it has immense power to control people's fear. Those who wield Frostfire can manipulate the primal terror in others' hearts, granting them formidable abilities of psychological manipulation. This dual nature—life-giving warmth and mind-controlling power—makes Frostfire both essential and dangerous. The Nabuhe guard their monopoly on this resource jealously, knowing that losing control of the Frostfire trade would mean losing their survival advantage in Venalthier's brutal climate.

### Ekri Towers

Tags: ruins, poi, geography

Twin spires of dark stone rising from the ice plain between Morelous and the Selengreyb Plateau—the only structures in Venalthier's interior, standing where no structures should be possible. The Ekri Towers have endured for millennia, their purpose unknown, their builders vanished, their presence unexplained.

#### Geography

The Ekri Towers stand approximately 150 miles south of The Face and 80 miles north of the Selengreyb Plateau's edge, in a region of relatively flat ice plain where no natural rock formations exist. They rise perhaps 200 feet from a shared base—a circular platform of worked stone roughly 100 feet in diameter.

The towers themselves are constructed from black basalt, similar to the volcanic rock found in The Face but showing no signs of natural formation. The stone is cut into precise blocks, fitted without mortar, rising in a slight taper toward pointed tips. Age has weathered the surfaces but hasn't compromised the structural integrity; whatever built these towers built them to last.

The surrounding ice shows no evidence of buried foundations or additional structures. The platform simply sits on the glacier surface, as though placed there rather than built. Geological analysis suggests the towers are at minimum 10,000 years old—far predating any known civilization in this region.

#### Architecture

The towers are not identical:

**The Eastern Tower**: Slightly taller and broader, with a single entrance at ground level. The interior contains a spiral staircase carved from the same black stone, ascending to an empty chamber at the top. Windows pierce the walls at irregular intervals, their openings oriented in directions that correspond to no obvious astronomical alignments.

**The Western Tower**: Shorter by perhaps 10 feet, with no visible entrance. The surface is smooth and unbroken, with no windows, doors, or apparent method of access. Whether an interior exists is unknown; attempts to breach the walls have failed, and the stone resists both physical and magical investigation.

**The Platform**: The shared base shows signs of deliberate construction—paved in the same black stone, with channels carved into the surface that may once have held water, metal, or something else entirely. The channels form geometric patterns that scholars have been unable to interpret, though they appear intentional rather than decorative.

#### Who Built Them

The Riin built the Ekri Towers approximately 2,500 years ago—five centuries before their civilization merged with the Eyendra forest.

At that time, the Riin controlled territory stretching from what is now Eyendra westward across Venalthier to the Scepter coast. The towers served as a way station and observation post, monitoring weather patterns and maintaining communication with settlements that no longer exist. The Riin built them from stone imported from the Scepter Mountains, using techniques that made the structures effectively permanent.

When the Riin began their merger with the land, most of their western infrastructure was abandoned. Settlements emptied, roads disappeared under ice, and the Riin consciousness contracted eastward into Eyendra. The towers should have been abandoned like everything else.

They weren't.

#### What's Inside the Western Tower

The western tower is sealed because something sealed itself inside.

During the Riin merger, one individual refused to join the collective consciousness. A woman named Ekri—the towers' last keeper—chose individual death over dissolution into the group mind. She climbed into the western tower, sealed the entrance with techniques that cannot be undone from outside, and waited to die alone.

She's still waiting.

Ekri didn't die. The same preservation magic that maintains Eyendra's boundary against the cold also preserved her, frozen in a state between life and death. She's been conscious inside that tower for two thousand years, unable to die, unable to leave, unable to join the collective she rejected.

The hum from the western tower is Ekri, still alive, still aware, still refusing. The Riin consciousness in Eyendra can sense her—a single point of individual identity where there should be none. They've tried to reach her; she won't respond. They've tried to break the seal; they can't. Ekri built the tower to last, and she sealed it against specifically the kind of consciousness her people were becoming.

The Nabuhe know about Ekri because she spoke to one of their ancestors, three centuries ago, through dreams. She explained what she'd done and why. She asked to be left alone. The Nabuhe have honored that request ever since.

#### Why The Eastern Tower Is Open

The eastern tower remains accessible because Ekri intended it as a refuge.

Before sealing herself away, she left supplies, records, and instructions in the eastern tower for anyone who might need shelter in the frozen waste. The spiral staircase leads to a chamber containing preserved Riin texts—historical records, magical treatises, and Ekri's personal journals describing the merger and why she refused it.

The time dilation effects aren't supernatural—they're a side effect of proximity to Ekri's preservation field. Time moves differently near someone frozen between life and death. The closer you get to the western tower, the more pronounced the effect becomes.

The dreams experienced by those who sleep near the towers are genuine communication. Ekri is lonely. Two thousand years of isolation have left her desperate for contact, even indirect contact through dreams. She shares fragments of Riin history, warnings about Venalthier's dangers, and occasionally useful information about the terrain. She doesn't ask for rescue—she knows there isn't one. She just wants someone to know she's still there.

#### Strange Phenomena

Those who've visited the Ekri Towers report various anomalies:

**Time Dilation**: Time seems to pass differently near the towers. Visitors report spending what felt like hours exploring the eastern tower, only to emerge and find days have passed—or the reverse, spending days that registered as minutes.

**Dreams**: Sleeping near the towers produces vivid, unsettling dreams. Common themes include drowning, falling through ice, and conversations with entities that speak in languages the dreamer doesn't understand but somehow comprehends.

**The Hum**: A low-frequency vibration is detectable within approximately one mile of the towers. It's felt more than heard—a pressure in the chest, a buzz in the teeth. The hum is constant and seems to emanate from the sealed western tower.

**Compass Behavior**: Compasses work normally near the towers—unlike other anomalous locations in Venalthier. Some scholars find this suspicious; the towers seem to be deliberately exempt from the magnetic disturbances that affect the rest of the region.

#### For Travelers

The Ekri Towers are the only shelter between Morelous and Selengreyb. This makes them attractive as a waypoint despite the strangeness that surrounds them:

- **Use the eastern tower for shelter** if necessary. The interior is warmer than the exterior and provides protection from wind.
- **Don't spend more than one night**. The time dilation effects seem to intensify with extended exposure.
- **Avoid the western tower**. You can't get in anyway, and the hum intensifies when approached.
- **Don't touch the channel patterns** on the platform. They're cold even by Venalthier standards, and contact produces numbness that can take hours to fade.
- **Pay attention to your dreams**. The tower dreams sometimes contain useful information—warnings about weather, directions to resources, fragments of maps. Whether this is communication or coincidence is unclear.

The towers have stood for at least ten thousand years, watching over empty ice. They'll stand for ten thousand more, regardless of who visits or what they learn. Whatever purpose they serve, they serve it without human participation.

The Nabuhe's silence suggests they know something about the towers. But knowing and speaking are different things, and some knowledge may be better kept.

A frozen sea in Venalthier.

TODO

### Morelous

Tags: plains, ice, geography

The western expanse of Venalthier's frozen interior, stretching from the Crystal Coast in the northwest to the West Selengreyb lowlands in the south. Morelous is marginally more hospitable than Pale Death to the east—not because conditions are better, but because occasional rocky outcrops provide minimal shelter and navigation points.

#### Geography

Morelous covers roughly 180 miles north to south and 120 miles east to west. The terrain is predominantly flat ice plain, similar to Pale Death, but punctuated by scattered rock formations where ancient mountains resist the glacial pressure. These outcrops—called "teeth" by the Nabuhe—rise 50-200 feet above the ice surface and occur roughly every 15-20 miles.

The region sits at lower elevation than the eastern interior, averaging 2,000-3,000 feet. This brings it closer to the moderating influence of the Dismar Deep, resulting in slightly less extreme conditions. "Slightly less extreme" in Venalthier still means temperatures averaging -25°C and persistent winds, but the difference between -25°C and -40°C is the difference between difficult survival and nearly impossible survival.

The ice here shows more variation than Pale Death's uniform white. Blue-tinged areas indicate compressed glacial ice reaching the surface; darker patches suggest volcanic rock just below the snow layer; occasional greenish zones mark where ancient algae somehow survive in the ice. The variation provides navigation references that Pale Death lacks entirely.

#### The Teeth

The rocky outcrops that define Morelous serve multiple purposes:

**Navigation**: Each tooth is distinctive—different height, different color, different profile. The Nabuhe have named all significant outcrops and use them as waypoints for travel. A journey across Morelous follows a chain of teeth rather than compass bearings alone.

**Shelter**: The leeward side of any tooth provides respite from the wind. Snow accumulates in these wind shadows, allowing construction of stable shelters. Expeditions plan their daily distances around reaching the next tooth before nightfall.

**Resources**: Some teeth contain caves or overhangs that offer more substantial shelter. A few have been developed into semi-permanent way stations, with cached supplies and improved shelter structures. The Nabuhe maintain these stations, though their locations aren't shared freely.

**Danger**: Predators know about the teeth too. Anything hunting on Morelous uses the outcrops as ambush points. Approaching a tooth carelessly is nearly as dangerous as not reaching one at all.

#### The Route to Scepter Mountains

Morelous provides the primary overland route between the Nabuhe settlements in East Whitewall and the coastal passes through the Scepter Mountains. This route sees the most traffic of any in Venalthier—which means perhaps a dozen parties per year in good conditions.

The journey covers approximately 150 miles across Morelous proper, following a chain of seven major teeth between the Whitewalls and the mountain foothills. Under optimal conditions, the crossing takes 5-7 days. Under normal conditions, 10-14 days is more realistic. Under poor conditions, the crossing doesn't happen.

Trade goods move along this route: Frostfire from the Nabuhe mines heading toward the coast for export; imported grain, metal tools, and luxuries heading back. The route's danger limits trade volume—only the most essential or valuable goods justify the risk.

#### Fauna

Morelous supports more life than other parts of Venalthier's interior:

**Ice Bears**: Polar bears wander the region, attracted by the slightly warmer conditions near the coast. They're the apex predators of Morelous, capable of bringing down anything they catch. The Nabuhe don't hunt them unless attacked; the risk isn't worth the reward.

**Snow Foxes**: Small, cunning, and numerous. They scavenge from bear kills and ambush smaller prey near the teeth. Their pelts are valuable, but trapping takes time travelers don't have.

**Tooth Spiders**: Large arachnids that survive the cold through unknown adaptations, living in caves and crevices within the teeth. They're venomous and aggressive when disturbed. Entering a tooth's caves without checking for spider occupation is a common way to die.

**Something Else**: Occasionally, travelers report tracks in the snow that match no known animal—too large for bears, too few limbs for any normal creature. The Nabuhe don't discuss these sightings. They simply advise avoiding the areas where such tracks appear.

#### Weather Patterns

Morelous sits in the path of storms rolling off the Dismar Deep. These storms are different from the interior's dry cold:

**Ocean Storms**: Relatively warm, wet air from the sea hits the frozen interior and dumps precipitation as heavy snow. These storms can last days, burying landmarks and making travel impossible. They're also warmer than the ambient cold, creating a paradoxical situation where storm conditions are more survivable than the clear weather that follows.

**Clear Periods**: After storms pass, temperatures drop dramatically as the cloud cover disappears. The temperature swing—from -10°C during a storm to -40°C after it passes—kills those who aren't prepared for the change.

**Wind Direction**: Storms bring easterly winds from the coast; clear weather brings the katabatic westerlies from the interior. A shift in wind direction predicts weather changes roughly 6-12 hours in advance.

#### For Travelers

Morelous is the least deadly part of Venalthier's interior—but "least deadly" is a relative term.

- **Plan for the teeth**. Know where they are before you start. Running out of daylight between teeth means exposure camping, which is often fatal.
- **Check caves carefully**. The shelter isn't worth the spider bite.
- **Respect the bears**. They own Morelous more than anyone else does. Give them wide berth.
- **Watch the wind**. Easterly wind means storm coming; westerly after a storm means plunging temperatures.
- **Carry extra supplies**. You will be delayed. The question is whether you prepared for it.

The Nabuhe travel Morelous routinely, but they've spent centuries developing the knowledge that makes routine travel possible. What's routine for them remains deadly for anyone else.

### Pale Death

Tags: plains, ice, geography, transition

The central-eastern expanse of Venalthier's frozen interior—a vast plain of ice and compacted snow stretching from The Face in the north to the Selengreyb Plateau in the south, and from Morelous in the west to where the ice meets the impossible boundary of Eyendra's living forest. Pale Death is named for what it is: featureless white emptiness where those who enter often don't return.

#### Geography

Pale Death covers roughly 200 miles north to south and 150 miles east to west—30,000 square miles of frozen nothing. The terrain is predominantly flat, with only the gentlest undulations breaking the monotony. Elevation rises gradually from roughly 3,000 feet at the northern edge near The Face to 4,500 feet where the ground rises toward Selengreyb Plateau.

The surface is hard-packed snow over ancient ice, compacted by millennia of pressure and wind. In most places, the snow layer is 10-20 feet thick, concealing the glacial ice beneath. The ground supports weight easily—travelers don't sink—but the uniform whiteness makes distance and direction impossible to judge.

No features exist to navigate by. No hills, no rocks, no variations in color. On overcast days, the sky and ground blend into a single white void where horizon ceases to exist. This is when Pale Death claims most of its victims: travelers who walk in circles until exhaustion takes them, their bodies found (if ever) miles from any intended destination.

#### The Eastern Boundary

Pale Death's most remarkable feature is what lies at its eastern edge: the Eyendra forest.

The transition is instant and impossible. There is no gradual thaw, no treeline creeping forward, no zone of scrub vegetation. One step is frozen wasteland; the next step is living boreal forest, the air ten degrees warmer, the ground bare of snow, the trees ancient and dense.

The boundary runs roughly north-south for perhaps 60 miles, marking where the Riin's merged consciousness refuses to let winter enter their domain. The Eyendra forest's edge is not natural—the trees grow right to the line and no further, their roots stopping precisely where the ice begins. Snow falling on the forest side sublimates before it can accumulate. Cold air hitting the tree canopy seems to deflect upward, as though striking an invisible wall.

No one understands how this boundary maintains itself. The Riin's merger with the land occurred two thousand years ago, yet the forest continues to defy the climate that should freeze it solid. Some scholars theorize the boundary is weakening gradually—that in another thousand years, Pale Death will finally claim Eyendra. Others note the boundary hasn't shifted an inch in recorded history and suggest it will outlast any observer.

#### Kama Sa'malina Proximity

The eastern portion of Pale Death borders not just Eyendra's edge but the Kama Sa'malina lake district—the "dreaming waters" where hundreds of lakes hold fragments of Riin consciousness. The boundary effect intensifies here: travelers on the ice sometimes hear voices from the forest, catch glimpses of faces in their peripheral vision, or dream of places they've never visited.

The dreams are the worst part. Travelers who camp near the Eyendra boundary wake with memories that aren't their own—fragments of lives lived centuries ago, emotions belonging to the dead, knowledge they couldn't possibly possess. Some handle this well. Others are found weeks later, still alive but speaking only in the Riin tongue, their original personalities seemingly replaced.

The dragon Ezra Olkanis claims the Eyendra forest as her domain. Her pact with Zor does not extend to Pale Death, but her influence sometimes does. Travelers on the ice have reported seeing her silhouette against the sunset, perched on trees at the forest's edge, watching the frozen plain with ancient patience. She doesn't intervene in what happens on the ice—but she watches.

#### Climate

Pale Death experiences the full force of Venalthier's polar climate:

**Temperature**: -30°C to -50°C year-round. Brief "warm" periods during high summer might reach -15°C, but such conditions are rare and unpredictable.

**Wind**: Constant. The katabatic flow from the Selengreyb Plateau creates persistent winds of 30-40 mph, with gusts exceeding 80 mph during storms. The wind is the primary killer—wind chill pushes effective temperatures to -70°C or colder.

**Visibility**: Variable and unreliable. Clear days offer visibility measured in miles; overcast conditions create total whiteout where you cannot see your own feet. Storms can reduce visibility to zero for days at a time.

**Precipitation**: Minimal. What little falls is immediately redistributed by wind. New snow doesn't accumulate—it simply rearranges what's already there.

#### Why "Pale Death"

The name is literal. The plain is pale—white ice, white snow, white sky. And it kills—sometimes through exposure, sometimes through something worse.

#### The Glassworms

Beneath Pale Death's ice live the glassworms—massive serpentine creatures, 40-80 feet long, composed of transparent crystalline flesh that makes them nearly invisible against the ice. They sense vibrations through the frozen surface and hunt by ambush, bursting through the snow layer to seize prey before retreating below.

The glassworms are ancient—fossils suggest they've existed since before the region froze, adapting as their temperate homeland became polar wasteland. Their crystalline bodies don't generate heat; they're as cold as the ice itself, which is how they survive temperatures that would kill warm-blooded creatures. They eat anything organic: travelers, bears, seals that wander too far inland, even frozen corpses.

The Nabuhe know exactly what the glassworms are. They hunt them occasionally—glassworm flesh, when properly prepared, provides months of nutrition, and the crystalline organs have alchemical value. But hunting glassworms is extremely dangerous, and the Nabuhe only attempt it when other food sources fail.

The bodies found in terror were people who saw a glassworm before it struck—the creatures are nearly invisible, but not quite, and the moment of recognition brings a very specific expression. The bodies found smiling were lured to the surface by the worms' secondary hunting method: glassworms can project illusions of warmth, shelter, and safety, drawing exhausted travelers toward their position. Victims who die this way look peaceful because they genuinely believed they were walking toward rescue.

The bodies never found were taken below the ice. Glassworms cache food, storing corpses in subsurface chambers for later consumption. The tunnels shift as the glacier flows, which is why searches fail—the bodies are there, but not where they were taken.

Glassworm territory covers most of Pale Death's interior. They're less common near the edges—the Eyendra boundary seems to repel them, and the Morelous teeth provide too little prey to attract large populations. But crossing the open plain means crossing glassworm hunting grounds, and the creatures can sense footsteps from hundreds of feet away.

#### Movement and Survival

Crossing Pale Death is technically possible. The Nabuhe do it occasionally when necessary, using techniques developed over centuries:

**Navigation**: Travel only on clear days when celestial navigation is possible. During overcast conditions, remain stationary. Use stakes driven into the ice to mark your trail—without them, you won't know if you're walking forward or in circles.

**Shelter**: Carry materials to construct emergency snow shelters. Build them tight against the wind; a poorly oriented shelter will be scoured away in hours.

**Speed**: Move as fast as conditions allow. Extended exposure is fatal. A crossing that should take three days must not take five.

**The Eastern Edge**: If you must approach the Eyendra boundary, maintain at least a mile of distance. Closer approach invites the dreams, and the dreams invite worse.

**Trust Nothing**: Mirages occur on Pale Death despite the cold. You will see things that aren't there—settlements, mountains, the edge of the ice. You will hear things—voices calling, music playing, sounds from home. Ignore them. Trust only your compass and your stakes.

#### For Travelers

Don't cross Pale Death.

If you must:

- **Hire Nabuhe guides** if any will agree. Their knowledge is the only reliable advantage available.
- **Accept that you may die**. Not as pessimism, but as fact. The prepared survive more often than the unprepared, but survival is never guaranteed.
- **Stay away from the eastern edge**. The dreams are worse than the cold.
- **If you become lost, stop immediately**. Dig in and wait for weather that allows navigation. Walking blind is walking dead.
- **If you see something strange, don't investigate**. Whatever is out there isn't looking for company. Let it pass.

The Nabuhe say Pale Death isn't evil—it simply has no concept of human survival. It doesn't want you dead; it doesn't want anything. You're meaningless to it. That indifference is worse than malice would be.

### Scepter Mountains

Tags: mountains, geography, coast

A rugged coastal mountain range running along the western edge of Venalthier, from the Eceraen junction in the north to where the peaks disappear beneath the Whitewall glaciers in the south. The Scepter Mountains form a natural barrier between the frozen interior and the Dismar Deep, their summits catching the last warmth from ocean currents before the polar cold consumes everything.

#### Geography

The Scepter Mountains extend roughly 300 miles north to south, with an average width of 40-50 miles. The range rises steeply from the coast, reaching elevations of 8,000-10,000 feet at the highest peaks before descending more gradually toward the Tundra Oblivio interior.

The mountains take their name from their profile when viewed from the sea: a series of sharp peaks that resemble the finials of an ornate scepter, each summit distinct and angular against the sky. The effect is most pronounced at sunset, when the peaks catch light while the lower slopes fall into shadow.

The western slopes face the Dismar Deep and receive significant precipitation—mostly snow, but occasional sleet and freezing rain during warmer periods. This creates substantial glaciation on the seaward faces. The eastern slopes are drier, sitting in the rain shadow, but equally frozen due to cold air drainage from the interior.

#### Terrain

The Scepter Mountains are geologically young and extremely rugged:

**Sharp Ridges**: The peaks haven't eroded into rounded forms; knife-edge ridges and near-vertical faces are common. Climbing is technical and dangerous.

**Glacial Valleys**: Deep U-shaped valleys cut between the major peaks, carved by glaciers that have since retreated. These valleys provide the only practical routes through the range.

**Unstable Rock**: The volcanic and sedimentary layers are prone to rockfall and avalanche. The freeze-thaw cycle cracks the stone constantly.

**Coastal Cliffs**: Where the mountains meet the sea, they do so abruptly. Sheer cliffs 500-2,000 feet tall plunge directly into the Dismar Deep, with no beaches and few landing points.

#### Climate

The Scepter Mountains experience a hybrid climate—coastal influence from the west, polar conditions from the east:

**Western Slopes**: Warmer than the interior, with temperatures occasionally reaching just above freezing even in winter. Heavy snowfall creates deep accumulation. Fog is common when warm ocean air meets cold mountain surfaces.

**Eastern Slopes**: Full polar conditions. The rain shadow means less precipitation, but what falls stays frozen. Temperatures match Tundra Oblivio levels. Wind exposure is extreme.

**Summits**: Permanently frozen, permanently wind-scoured. Nothing survives at elevation.

#### Strategic Value

The Scepter Mountains matter for two reasons:

**Coastal Access**: The range contains the only viable landing points on Venalthier's western coast. Several fjords penetrate the mountain wall, providing protected harbors where ships can anchor. These landing points are the primary connection between Venalthier and the outside world—everything that enters or leaves the frozen south by sea passes through the Scepter coast.

**Route Through**: The glacial valleys provide the only passable routes between the coast and the interior. Anyone traveling from the Dismar Deep to Tundra Oblivio or the Whitewall settlements must pass through the Scepter Mountains. There are perhaps three or four viable passes, and all of them are dangerous.

#### The Fjords

Several deep inlets cut into the Scepter coast, remnants of glacial carving:

**Deepest Reach**: The largest fjord, extending nearly 15 miles inland. The innermost waters remain ice-free year-round, warmed by currents from the Dismar Deep. This is the primary entry point for ships serving Venalthier.

**Shatter Bay**: A wide, shallow inlet where ice calving from the surrounding glaciers fills the water with dangerous bergs. Navigation is treacherous, but the bay provides access to the northern passes.

**Ghostwater**: A narrow, mist-shrouded fjord where the water appears to glow faintly in darkness—some property of bioluminescent organisms that survive in the unusual conditions. Local legend claims the glow is the spirits of drowned sailors. The practical effect is that Ghostwater is navigable even in darkness, making it valuable for winter arrivals when daylight is scarce.

#### Wildlife

The Scepter Mountains support more life than the interior tundra, though not by much:

**Seabirds**: Large colonies nest on the coastal cliffs, surviving on fish from the Dismar Deep. Their guano creates distinctive white streaks down the dark rock faces.

**Seals and Sea Lions**: Haul out on rocky ledges along the coast. Hunted by anyone who can reach them.

**Mountain Goats**: A hardy subspecies adapted to the extreme conditions. Their wool and meat are valuable; reaching them on the steep terrain is difficult.

**Predators**: Snow leopards, white wolves, and the occasional polar bear wander the mountains. All are dangerous; all are rare.

#### Passage Through

The Scepter passes are the only overland routes into Venalthier's interior. All are difficult:

**Coldgate**: The northernmost pass, connecting to the Eceraen foothills. Highest in elevation but shortest in distance. Impassable in winter due to snow accumulation.

**Scepter Gap**: The primary year-round route, lower and longer than Coldgate. Maintained by the Nabuhe as their supply line from the coast. Travelers pay tolls or don't pass.

**Southern Route**: No formal name—a difficult climb over the southern peaks where they begin to merge with the Whitewall glaciers. Only used by those desperate to avoid Nabuhe tolls.

#### For Travelers

The Scepter Mountains are dangerous but navigable with preparation:

- **Use the fjords** for coastal access. Don't attempt to land on open cliffs—the rocks will shred your hull.
- **Pay the tolls** at Scepter Gap unless you have compelling reasons to avoid Nabuhe contact. The alternative routes are significantly more dangerous.
- **Carry supplies for delays**. Weather can close passes for days. Running out of food while waiting for a storm to clear is a common way to die.
- **Respect the glaciers**. Crevasses are invisible under fresh snow. Roped travel is mandatory on any ice field.

The mountains are harsh but honest. They don't hide their dangers—anyone can see the cliffs, the glaciers, the exposed ridges. What kills people is underestimating how quickly conditions change, and how far they are from help when things go wrong.

### Selengreyb Plateau

Tags: plateau, ice, geography

The elevated heart of Venalthier—a vast icy plateau rising 5,000-6,000 feet above sea level, forming the source region for the glacial flows that define the continent's frozen character. Selengreyb is where the cold is born; the winds that scour Pale Death and Morelous originate here, flowing downhill from this frozen highland.

#### Geography

The Selengreyb Plateau stretches roughly 250 miles east to west and 150 miles north to south, occupying the central-southern portion of Venalthier. The surface is predominantly bare ice—ancient glacial accumulation compressed into a solid mass hundreds of feet thick. Snow falls here but doesn't stay; the constant wind redistributes it to lower elevations.

The plateau is not flat despite its name. Broad undulations create a rolling terrain of gentle rises and shallow depressions, with elevation variations of 100-300 feet over distances of several miles. These variations are invisible from ground level—the uniform white creates the illusion of flatness while travelers constantly climb and descend without realizing it.

The ice surface is dangerously smooth. Centuries of wind polishing have created zones where the ice is nearly frictionless—what the Nabuhe call "mirror ice." Travelers who step onto mirror ice often can't stop themselves from sliding; some have been carried hundreds of feet before friction finally slowed them. On slopes, the slides can reach terminal velocity.

#### West Selengreyb

The western margin of the plateau descends through a broad transition zone called West Selengreyb. This region—roughly 60 miles wide—represents the slope between the high plateau and the lower Morelous plains.

West Selengreyb is where the katabatic winds are born. Cold, dense air pools on the plateau surface, then flows downhill under its own weight. The slope accelerates this flow, creating persistent winds of 40-60 mph that blast westward toward the coast. During cold snaps, these winds can exceed 100 mph—hurricane force—for days at a time.

The transition zone is worse than either the plateau or the plains. It combines the plateau's extreme cold with the plains' exposure, while the wind accelerates to its maximum velocity precisely in this band. No shelter exists; the slope is too consistent to create wind shadows. Crossing West Selengreyb is the most dangerous leg of any east-west journey through Venalthier.

#### Elevation Effects

The plateau's altitude creates conditions more extreme than anywhere else in Venalthier:

**Temperature**: Averaging -40°C to -50°C year-round, with extremes reaching -70°C during polar night. The altitude adds perhaps 10°C of additional cold compared to the lowlands.

**Pressure**: The thin air at 6,000 feet causes altitude sickness in those not acclimated. Combined with cold and wind, this creates a triple threat that exhausts travelers rapidly.

**Isolation**: The plateau is further from help than anywhere in Venalthier. An emergency on Selengreyb is almost certainly fatal; no rescue is coming.

#### Why It Matters

Selengreyb's practical importance is minimal—no resources exist, no settlements are viable, no trade routes cross it. But the plateau shapes everything around it:

**Climate Control**: The cold air produced here drives Venalthier's weather patterns. Understanding Selengreyb means understanding why Venalthier is what it is.

**Glacial Source**: The ice mass of the plateau flows slowly outward in all directions, feeding the glaciers that eventually become the Whitewalls. Selengreyb is a frozen reservoir, constantly replenishing what calves off the coastal cliffs.

**Barrier**: The plateau effectively divides Venalthier into western and eastern sectors. Traveling around it is long; traveling across it is nearly impossible.

#### The Depression

Near the plateau's center, a shallow depression perhaps 20 miles across marks where a fragment of the lost third moon struck Alaria during the Ezz Rift, 120 million years ago.

Before the Rift, Alaria had three moons. The cataclysm that created the planar stack also shattered the third moon, scattering debris across the world. Most pieces burned up or struck the oceans. One major fragment—perhaps a mile across—hit the Selengreyb region when it was still temperate land, burying itself deep in the bedrock before the glaciers formed.

The lunar fragment is still down there, preserved under hundreds of feet of ice. The material that composed the lost moon was different from ordinary stone—it contained concentrated planar resonance, crystallized connections to the astral and elemental planes. That material is still active. The compass anomalies come from its magnetic properties. The headaches and nausea come from exposure to low-level planar radiation. The dreams of drowning in ice are memories leaking from the fragment—the moon's final moments as it fell.

The Nabuhe know what's buried there. Their ancestors witnessed Riin scholars attempting to excavate it, two thousand years ago. The expedition went mad; the survivors described seeing through the ice into the astral plane, experiencing time in random order, and hearing the moon speak to them. The Riin abandoned the project and, shortly after, began their merger with Eyendra—possibly as a direct result of what they learned from the lunar fragment.

The material is immensely valuable if it could be extracted. Concentrated planar resonance would revolutionize magical research, enable new forms of planar travel, and potentially restore connections to planes that have grown distant since the Rift. No one has successfully extracted any. The ice is too deep, the conditions too harsh, and the psychological effects too severe. Those who stay too long stop wanting to leave, convinced the moon is about to share something important—if they just listen a little longer.

#### For Travelers

Don't go to Selengreyb Plateau.

This isn't the cautious advice given for other parts of Venalthier. This is simple assessment: the plateau offers nothing worth the certainty of death that attempting to reach it involves.

If you find yourself on the plateau despite all reason:

- **Watch for mirror ice**. Test the surface with a stake before committing your weight.
- **Descend immediately**. Every hour at elevation increases the likelihood of altitude sickness, hypothermia, and death.
- **Avoid the central depression**. Whatever is there, it's not your concern.
- **Pray to whatever powers you honor**. On Selengreyb, that's approximately as useful as any other survival strategy.

The Nabuhe have a saying: "The plateau is where gods go to die." Whether this is metaphor or something more literal, they won't explain.

### The Face

Tags: cliffs, geography, landmark

A massive cliff formation rising between West Whitewall and East Whitewall, forming the central portion of Venalthier's northern ice barrier. The Face takes its name from a natural rock formation visible in the cliff that resembles a colossal human visage—though whether it is truly natural remains a matter of debate among those few who have seen it.

#### Geography

The Face stretches roughly 80 miles along the boundary between the glaciated south and the Tundra Oblivio to the north. Unlike the pure ice of West Whitewall or the rock-and-ice composite of East Whitewall, The Face is predominantly exposed stone—dark volcanic basalt that has resisted glacial erosion where the softer surrounding terrain has been carved away.

The cliffs rise 600-800 feet from the glacier surface, their faces nearly vertical in most sections. The rock is heavily fractured, with deep horizontal cracks that create the appearance of stacked layers and vertical fissures that have widened over millennia of freeze-thaw cycling.

At the center of the formation, visible from miles away on clear days, the cliff face bears an uncanny resemblance to a human face in profile—a jutting brow, the hollow of an eye socket, a straight nose, thin lips, a strong chin. The features are too precise to dismiss as coincidence, too weathered to be obviously carved. The Face stares eternally north, toward Tundra Oblivio and the lands beyond.

#### What It Actually Is

The Face is a titan—one of the colossal beings that walked Alaria before the God War, killed in battle and frozen into the cliff where it fell.

The Nabuhe know this. Their oral histories describe the final days of the titan called Velkoreth the Watchful, who fled south during the God War's climax, pursued by forces that no longer exist. Velkoreth died here, its body flash-frozen by magical cold that still radiates from its bones millennia later. The "cliff" is its skull and upper torso, petrified and fused with the volcanic rock it fell against. The features aren't carved or coincidental—they're the actual face of a dead god-thing, preserved by ice and time.

The Nabuhe don't discuss this with outsiders because they serve as Velkoreth's wardens. Their ancestors made a pact: they would watch the body, ensure nothing disturbed it, and receive in return the Frostfire that bleeds from the titan's slowly-decaying heart deep within the mountain. The Frostfire isn't a natural resource—it's Velkoreth's life force, crystallized and harvestable. The supply will eventually run out; when it does, the titan will be truly dead rather than merely frozen between states.

This is why the Nabuhe discourage western travel from East Whitewall. This is why they maintain silence. The titan is dead but not gone, and some knowledge invites attention from things that remember the God War and might want to finish what was started.

#### Approach and Access

The Face can be approached from three directions:

**From Tundra Oblivio (north)**: The glacier rises gradually until it meets the cliff base. Travelers can walk across the ice to within touching distance of the rock, though the journey across the tundra is dangerous and the cliff offers no shelter once reached.

**From Pale Death (south)**: The southern approach requires climbing the glacier that banks against the cliff's southern face. The ice is crevassed and unstable, making this route more dangerous than the northern approach despite being shorter.

**From East Whitewall (east)**: The Nabuhe territory connects to The Face's eastern end, but the Nabuhe discourage visitors from traveling in that direction. No formal prohibition exists, but Nabuhe guides become unavailable and warnings about ice conditions multiply when western travel is discussed.

#### The Eye

Within the face formation, the eye socket—a deep concavity approximately 100 feet across—contains the titan's actual eye, still partially liquid after all these millennia.

The Eye is not water. It's vitreous fluid from Velkoreth's preserved ocular globe, mixed with meltwater and titan tears that still seep from ducts in the surrounding bone. The warmth comes from residual life—the same slow decay that produces Frostfire. The Eye is, in a very real sense, still alive.

Drinking from the Eye doesn't induce visions—it grants access to Velkoreth's memories. The titan was called "the Watchful" because it observed everything, accumulating millennia of knowledge before the God War. Those who drink the Eye fluid experience fragments of that observation: battles witnessed, civilizations rising and falling, the faces of beings who no longer exist. The experience is often overwhelming. Some who drink can't process what they learn and emerge speaking languages no one recognizes or describing places that don't exist anymore.

The Nabuhe forbid their children from approaching the Eye not out of superstition but out of knowledge: a child's mind cannot contain what Velkoreth saw. Adults who drink and survive gain genuine knowledge—historical facts, forgotten techniques, the locations of buried things. The price is carrying a dead titan's memories alongside your own, which some find enriching and others find maddening.

Reaching the Eye requires climbing the cliff face—approximately 400 feet of vertical ascent on fractured bone that resembles basalt. The Nabuhe maintain a hidden route for their own use; outsiders must find their own way up.

#### Wildlife

The Face hosts the largest seabird colonies in Venalthier. Thousands of birds nest in the cliff's horizontal cracks during breeding season, taking advantage of the thermal anomaly that keeps the rock slightly warmer than the surrounding ice. Their guano streaks the dark basalt white in places, creating patterns that some observers claim form writing in unknown scripts.

The birds are the only consistent life on The Face. No mammals den in the cliffs; no fish swim in the Eye's waters despite its temperature; no insects survive the conditions. Just the birds, wheeling and crying above the ice, and the vast stone face staring forever north.

#### For Travelers

The Face is a destination for scholars, mystics, and the deeply curious. It offers no practical resources, no shelter, and no safety. The journey to reach it is dangerous; remaining near it offers no particular benefit beyond satisfying curiosity.

If you must visit:

- **Approach from the north** if possible. The glacier crossing is brutal but more predictable than the southern crevasse fields.
- **Don't drink from the Eye** unless you're prepared for consequences you can't predict.
- **Note the Nabuhe silence**. They've watched The Face for centuries and they don't discuss it. There's a reason.
- **Watch the birds**. Their movements sometimes suggest they're reacting to things humans can't perceive. When they go silent, leave.

The Face has watched the north for longer than human memory. Whatever it is—natural formation, ancient sculpture, or something else entirely—it will continue watching long after any visitor has gone.

### Tundra Oblivio

Tags: tundra, geography, wasteland

The vast frozen interior of northern Venalthier, stretching from the southern slopes of the Eceraen Mountains to the edge of the Whitewall glacier fields. Tundra Oblivio is perhaps the most inhospitable habitable region in Alaria—a windswept wasteland where nothing grows, nothing shelters, and survival is measured in hours rather than days.

#### Geography

Tundra Oblivio occupies roughly 400 miles north to south and 500 miles east to west—a staggering expanse of frozen emptiness. The terrain is predominantly flat, with only the Blerian Hills and Scepter Mountains breaking the monotony. The ground is permafrost year-round, frozen solid to depths of hundreds of feet.

The tundra sits at moderate elevation, sloping gradually downward from the Eceraen Mountains in the north to the Whitewall cliffs in the south. This creates a persistent drainage pattern: meltwater from the mountains flows south across the frozen plain, cutting shallow channels that freeze solid in winter and become rushing torrents during the brief summer thaw.

Visibility across the tundra is theoretically unlimited—the flat terrain and lack of vegetation mean you can see for miles in clear conditions. In practice, visibility is often measured in feet. Wind-driven snow creates ground blizzards even on sunny days; fog rolls in from the coast; and whiteout conditions make navigation impossible.

#### Climate

Tundra Oblivio experiences polar conditions year-round:

**Winter** (roughly 8 months): Temperatures drop to -40°C or colder. Darkness lasts 20+ hours per day at the solstice. Wind chill makes exposed skin deadly within minutes. The ground is covered in hard-packed snow and ice.

**Summer** (roughly 4 months): Temperatures climb to just above freezing on the warmest days. The sun barely dips below the horizon, creating perpetual twilight rather than true darkness. The surface layer of permafrost partially thaws, turning the ground into a treacherous mix of mud, ice, and standing water.

**Wind**: The defining feature of the tundra. Cold air flowing off the Whitewall glaciers creates persistent katabatic winds that blast northward across the plain. Wind speeds of 50-70 mph are common; 100+ mph gusts occur regularly. The wind never stops completely. Ever.

#### The Blerian Hills

Rising from the central tundra, the Blerian Hills provide the only significant elevation change between the Eceraen range and the Whitewall. These are not mountains—the highest peaks reach perhaps 1,500 feet above the surrounding plain—but in a landscape of absolute flatness, they loom large.

The hills are composed of ancient volcanic rock, harder than the surrounding sedimentary plain and resistant to glacial erosion. Their presence creates minor wind shadows on their southern slopes, making them one of the few places on the tundra where snow doesn't immediately scour away. This relative shelter has attracted what little life exists in the region.

Lichens grow on the Blerian Hills—the only vegetation in Tundra Oblivio. Small rodents burrow in the rocky soil during summer. Arctic foxes and snow owls hunt the rodents. It's not much of an ecosystem, but it's more than exists anywhere else in the region.

The hills are also rumored to contain ruins—structures buried under ice and rock that predate any known civilization. Expeditions have occasionally reported finding carved stone beneath the permafrost, but the conditions make excavation nearly impossible. Whatever lies buried in the Blerian Hills has remained buried for millennia.

#### Morya

On the northern edge of the Blerian Hills, where the slopes descend toward the Eceraen foothills, sits Morya—the only permanent settlement in Tundra Oblivio.

"Settlement" overstates the case. Morya is a collection of ice-block shelters and underground burrows occupied by perhaps 200 souls at peak population. Its residents are outcasts, fugitives, and madmen—people who have chosen to live in conditions that would kill most others rather than face whatever awaited them in civilization.

Morya survives because of three factors:

**Location**: The northern Blerian Hills receive slightly less wind than the open tundra, and proximity to the Eceraen range means occasional game wanders down from the relatively richer hunting grounds to the north.

**Frostfire**: A trickle of Frostfire trade reaches Morya from the Nabuhe dwarves in East Whitewall. Without this magical heat source, the settlement would be impossible. The Nabuhe charge extortionate prices, knowing Morya has no alternatives.

**Desperation**: The people who live here have nowhere else to go. They endure conditions that would break others because the alternative is death—either from the cold or from whatever they fled.

Morya has no formal government, no economy beyond barter, and no future. It exists because people continue to arrive, and some of them survive long enough to help the next arrivals. That's all.

#### Wildlife

Tundra Oblivio supports almost no life:

**Migrating Birds**: Some species cross the tundra during seasonal migrations, but none stop. There's nothing to eat.

**Arctic Foxes and Wolves**: Small populations exist in the Blerian Hills, surviving on the limited prey available there. They don't venture onto the open tundra.

**Polar Bears**: Occasionally wander inland from the coastal ice. Extremely dangerous—a starving polar bear will eat anything it catches, and on the open tundra, it can catch anything it sees.

**Ice Worms**: Disputed. Some travelers report seeing massive worms—20, 30, 50 feet long—burrowing through the permafrost. Others dismiss these as hallucinations born of cold and exhaustion. The descriptions are consistent enough to suggest something lives under the ice, but no specimen has ever been recovered.

#### Navigation

Crossing Tundra Oblivio is theoretically possible but practically suicidal.

**No Landmarks**: The terrain is featureless. Once you lose sight of the mountains (which happens quickly in poor visibility), there's nothing to navigate by. Compasses work, but magnetic interference near the pole makes them unreliable.

**No Shelter**: There's nothing to hide behind, nothing to build with, nothing to burn. Survival requires carrying everything you need—and carrying enough supplies for a multi-day crossing means carrying more weight than most can manage.

**No Rescue**: If something goes wrong on the open tundra, no one is coming to help. Morya can't mount rescue expeditions; the Nabuhe won't; and no one else is close enough to matter.

The only viable crossing routes hug the edges of the tundra—following the Eceraen foothills along the north, or the Scepter Mountains along the west coast. The open interior is death.

#### For Travelers

Don't cross Tundra Oblivio unless you have no other choice.

If you must:

- **Travel along edges only**. The Eceraen foothills and Scepter Mountains provide marginal shelter and navigation references. The open tundra provides nothing.
- **Carry Frostfire** if you can obtain it. Magical heat is the only reliable warmth source; conventional fires are impossible in the wind.
- **Move fast**. Extended exposure is fatal. Plan to cover ground quickly rather than camping extensively.
- **Watch for weather**. Storms can materialize within minutes. When visibility drops, stop immediately and shelter in place. Moving in a whiteout means dying in a whiteout.
- **Avoid Morya** unless desperate. The settlement survives on the edge of viability; visitors strain resources that are already inadequate. You're not welcome unless you bring supplies worth more than you'll consume.

The Nabuhe have a saying: "The tundra doesn't want you dead. It simply doesn't care whether you live." They're being generous. The tundra doesn't notice you at all.

### West Whitewall

Tags: cliffs, glacier, geography

The western terminus of the great Whitewall—a continuous ice cliff stretching across southern Venalthier where the continental glaciers meet the sea. West Whitewall marks where the Scepter Mountains disappear beneath the ice sheet, their peaks becoming mere nunataks before vanishing entirely into the frozen mass.

#### Geography

West Whitewall extends roughly 150 miles along the southwestern coast of Venalthier, where the glacier front meets the Dismar Deep. The ice cliffs rise 200-400 feet above the waterline, with an additional 100+ feet extending below the surface. The total ice thickness at the wall face is typically 500-600 feet.

Unlike East Whitewall, where the cliffs are carved into a mountainside, West Whitewall is pure glacier—a solid mass of compressed ice flowing slowly from the interior ice cap toward the sea. The wall is the glacier's edge, where the ice sheet ends and the ocean begins.

The wall face is constantly changing. Chunks calve off regularly, creating icebergs that drift into the Dismar Deep. Fresh ice flows forward to replace what's lost. The process is noisy—booming cracks echo across the water as new fissures open, followed by thunderous crashes when sections collapse. From a distance, the wall seems static; up close, it's constantly in motion.

#### Character

West Whitewall has a different character than its eastern counterpart:

**No Settlement**: Unlike East Whitewall, where the Nabuhe have carved homes into the frozen rock, West Whitewall is uninhabited. The ice itself provides no stable surface for construction—anything built would eventually calve into the sea. The few rock outcrops that pierce the glacier are too small and exposed to support permanent occupation.

**No Resources**: East Whitewall has Frostfire. West Whitewall has only ice—abundant, useless ice. There's no reason to come here except to see the wall itself or to pass beyond it.

**Pure Desolation**: East Whitewall is harsh but inhabited. West Whitewall is simply empty. The only sounds are the glacier's groaning, the crash of calving ice, and the wind. No birds nest on the unstable ice face. No seals haul out on surfaces that might collapse at any moment. The wall is as close to true lifelessness as anywhere on the surface of Alaria.

#### The Ice Shelf

South of the visible wall face, the glacier extends underwater and eventually resurfaces as a floating ice shelf. This shelf extends perhaps 20-30 miles into the Dismar Deep before breaking up into discrete icebergs.

The shelf is navigable in theory—flat ice extending over open water, solid enough to walk on in most places. In practice, the shelf is treacherous. Crevasses open without warning. Pressure ridges create impassable barriers. Sections break away and drift, stranding anyone caught on them. The ice that looks solid may be only inches thick over deep water.

Ships avoid the shelf entirely, giving it a wide berth. The icebergs it spawns are hazard enough; approaching the source would be suicidal.

#### Approaches

West Whitewall can be approached from three directions:

**By Sea (West)**: Ships from the Dismar Deep can view the wall from a safe distance. Approaching closer than a mile is risky—calving events can create waves that swamp small vessels, and underwater ice extensions can damage hulls. The wall is impressive from the water but inaccessible.

**From Tundra Oblivio (North)**: The glacier rises gradually from the tundra, transitioning from permafrost to ice sheet over perhaps 10-15 miles. The boundary is marked by increasing crevasse density; the point where the ice becomes impassable is obvious. Travelers can walk to within view of the wall face but cannot safely approach the edge.

**From the Scepter Mountains (Northwest)**: The southern Scepter peaks are absorbed by the glacier. Following the mountain edge allows travelers to approach the wall where ice meets rock, but the terrain becomes increasingly dangerous as the mountains disappear beneath the ice.

#### What Lies Beyond

South of West Whitewall—beyond the ice shelf, beyond the icebergs—the Dismar Deep opens toward the polar ocean. No ships have explored these waters extensively. The few that have ventured south report endless ice floes, persistent fog, and magnetic anomalies that make navigation unreliable.

Rumors persist of land beyond the ice—islands, or perhaps a southern continent, glimpsed through breaks in the fog. No verified discovery supports these claims. The polar ocean remains largely unknown, its secrets locked behind the Whitewall barrier and the hostile conditions that make exploration impossible.

#### Comparison to East Whitewall

The two Whitewalls are connected—part of the same glacial system—but differ significantly:

| Feature | West Whitewall | East Whitewall |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| Composition | Pure glacier ice | Ice over rock cliff |
| Stability | Constantly calving | Relatively stable |
| Settlement | None | Nabuhe dwarves |
| Resources | None | Frostfire deposits |
| Access | Extremely limited | Difficult but established |
| Strategic value | None | Controls heat supply |

East Whitewall matters because people live there and resources exist. West Whitewall matters only as a landmark—the visible terminus of the ice sheet, marking where habitable land ends absolutely.

#### For Travelers

There's no reason to visit West Whitewall. Nothing to gain, nothing to find, significant risk for no reward.

If you find yourself approaching anyway:

- **Stay back from the face**. Calving events can drop house-sized blocks of ice without warning. The splash zone extends further than you'd expect.
- **Don't walk on the ice shelf**. It looks solid. It isn't. The sea below is cold enough to kill in minutes.
- **The glacier is not climbable**. The surface is crevassed, unstable, and offers no purchase. Attempting to scale the wall face is suicide.
- **Watch for weather**. The ice creates its own microclimate—cold air drainage, fog formation, sudden temperature drops. Conditions at the wall are worse than conditions a mile away.

The Nabuhe, who know Venalthier better than anyone, have a simple policy regarding West Whitewall: they don't go there. They don't need to, and neither do you.
