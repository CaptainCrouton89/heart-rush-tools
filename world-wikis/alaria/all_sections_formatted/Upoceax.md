# Upoceax

Tags: continent

Upoceax (pronounced "YOO-poe-say") is one of the three major continents of Alaria, located in the southwest.

## Seacleft Coast

### Geography

The Seacleft Coast occupies the northwestern edge of Upoceax—a rugged coastal region featuring dramatic cliffs that drop into the ocean. This is a land of precipitous shorelines, scattered states, and the gateway between the Farlands to the south and the waters beyond.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Northern coastline
- **East**: The Greenwater Sea and Sand Reach desert
- **South**: Transitions into the Farlands; the Vokas Enrisikna mountain range marks the boundary
- **West**: Ocean of Elorinia

#### The Vokas Enrisikna Range

A small mountain range that stretches between the Ocean of Elorinia to the west and the Bejeweled Sea to the east. This range serves as the geographic boundary between the Seacleft Coast and the Farlands to the south.

#### States

The Seacleft Coast contains a smattering of states, arranged roughly from south to north:

- **Ios** (southernmost)
- **Moigos**
- **Iqes**
- **Enavadi** (northernmost)

Plus several scattered city-states throughout the region.

#### Terrain

The defining feature is the coastline itself—high cliffs dropping dramatically into the ocean. The interior is less dramatic but still rugged, transitioning from the coastal cliffs to the mountain boundaries.

#### Surrounding Waters

- **Ocean of Elorinia**: The western ocean
- **Bejeweled Sea**: Eastern waters, between the Seacleft Coast and the Greenwater Sea
- **Greenwater Sea**: Further east, dominated by the island of Urok

#### Coral Hills

Hills made of coral/sandstone that have been revealed after sea levels fell. Full of deep caves. Rumored that lots of pirates have their treasure buried here. Immune to stone magic, so quite secure.

#### Shardmaw Isles

Northwest of Gyosha and west of the Coral Hills lie the Shardmaw Isles—a treacherous archipelago rich in magical crystals. These razor-sharp crystalline formations jut from the seafloor, some rising up to forty feet above the water's surface. The crystals are prized for weapon-making, capable of holding an impossibly keen edge, but they are equally effective at destroying ships.

Navigating the Shardmaw Isles is a deadly proposition—the crystalline protrusions tear through hulls with ease, sending vessels to the bottom. The isles are adjacent to the Shipwreck Hills, where boats torn to pieces by the crystal fangs frequently wash ashore, their wreckage a testament to the danger these waters pose.

#### Shipwreck Hills

West of Gyosha lie the Shipwreck Hills—a series of islands whose hills are dotted with the remains of countless wrecked vessels. Ships destroyed by the nearby Shardmaw Isles wash ashore here, their broken hulls littering the landscape like tombstones in a maritime graveyard.

The hills are inhospitable not just because of the treacherous terrain, but because they are home to rusalka and wyrms. The wyrms—serpentine creatures that once roamed the crust of the world as titans the size of mountain ranges—have diminished over the ages. Now they rarely exceed a thousand feet in length, but they are still formidable predators. The combination of predatory wyrms and deadly water spirits makes the Shipwreck Hills a place to avoid, despite the potential salvage opportunities among the wrecks.

### Iqes

#### Golem's Teeth

An archipelago of jagged islands east of Iqes proper, named for the sharp, tooth-like rock formations that rise from the sea. The treacherous waters and razor-sharp rocks have claimed countless ships over the centuries.

##### Islands North of Golem's Teeth

The smaller islands scattered north of the main Golem's Teeth archipelago are avoided by sailors who know the local legends.

###### Dreadwreck

The location of a cursed shipwreck—a Gruynmar vessel that ran aground after its entire crew was petrified by a gorgon. The ship smashed against the rocks and now lies broken on the shore, its stone crew still frozen in their final moments of terror. The wreck is shunned by all who know of it, as the gorgon still makes its lair among the petrified sailors, waiting for new victims to add to its collection of statues.

#### Ederri

An underwater sinkhole region off the eastern coast of Iqes in the Agreben Sea. The sinkholes descend into deep underwater caverns and passages.

##### Voidlock Passage

Deep within the Ederri sinkholes lies the collapsed, underwater Voidlock Passage—once a seagate leading to the underrealm of Zylogmus Eternus. The passage has collapsed but remains partially functional in a strange way: as you descend deeper and deeper into the flooded tunnels, the water becomes shared between the two locations, existing in both places simultaneously. This creates a dangerous phenomenon where currents from Zylogmus Eternus can pull swimmers into the underrealm without warning.

West of the mainland settlement of Eskiloko, situated in the waters between Moigos and the Tyvern Isles, lies the Isle of the Night—a mysterious island enveloped within the Gloomterror Forest.

##### Gloomterror Forest

An otherworldly forest that covers the island, where darkness is absolute and unnatural.

###### Blackpoint

An island location within the Gloomterror Forest, totally shrouded in impenetrable shadows. No source of light works on this island—torches gutter, magical light fails, and even the sun seems unable to pierce the supernatural darkness.

Immense treasure is said to be buried on Blackpoint, drawing countless treasure hunters despite the impossibility of searching in absolute darkness. The island is guarded by umbral citadels—living shadows that have taken fortress-form, attacking any who dare set foot on the lightless shore.

### Tyvern Isles

A group of islands off the Seacleft Coast, home to the Tuktuk people. The islands are dominated by dense jungle and mysterious ruins.

#### Jungles of Tyvern

The interior of the Tyvern Isles is covered in thick tropical jungle, dangerous and wild.

##### Tower of Gwyndar

An ancient fortress deep in the jungles, serving as a landmark and strategic position. The tower predates current Tuktuk settlement and shows signs of much older construction.

##### Black Forest

Located in the jungles near the Tower of Gwyndar, the Black Forest is an unnatural place where nearly all color has been drained away. Your shadow can leave your body here, becoming separated and wandering independently—a deeply unsettling phenomenon that can result in permanent loss of one's shadow.

Large ogres that have lost their shadows live in this forest, hunting by the absence of light rather than its presence. The forest is extremely dangerous, as those who lose their shadows often lose part of their essence, becoming hollow and susceptible to possession by shadow entities.

#### Southern Tyvern

The southern islands of the Tyvern archipelago feature different terrain and resources from the central jungles.

##### Ribwood Forest

A forest on the southern Tyvern Islands, home to a rare and valuable tree species known as ribwood. This remarkable wood is completely fireproof—it doesn't burn under any circumstances, making it incredibly valuable for shipbuilding. Wealthy merchants and pirates prize ribwood vessels above all others, as they're immune to fire arrows, Greek fire, and the countless other flame-based hazards of naval warfare.

However, harvesting ribwood comes at a cost. The Tuktuk people live in and around the Ribwood Forest, and they fiercely resent outsiders who ravage their homeland for profit. Logging expeditions into the forest frequently end in violence, with Tuktuk warriors ambushing the loggers. Despite the danger, the lure of fireproof ships ensures that treasure-seekers continue to risk the Tuktuk's wrath to harvest the precious wood.

## Farlands

### Geography

The Farlands occupy the entire western coastal region of Upoceax—a land of ancient forests dominated by the three Elven Kingdoms. This is one of the oldest civilized regions of the continent, where elven cultures have flourished for millennia.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Transitions into the Seacleft Coast
- **East**: The Kelder Mountains and Sand Reach Mountains
- **South**: Wycendeula forests
- **West**: Ocean of Elorinia

#### The Three Elven Kingdoms

The Farlands are politically defined by three major elven states, arranged roughly from south to north:

- **Illron**: The southernmost elven kingdom
- **Lenora**: The middle kingdom, north of Illron
- **Deo Esari**: The northernmost kingdom, centered in the Kelder Mountains—the north-south range that runs along the eastern edge of the Farlands and is bisected by the Sand Reach Range

#### The Kelder Mountains

A major north-south mountain range along the eastern boundary of the Farlands. This range is bisected by the Sand Reach Mountains where they meet. The Deo Esari elves have made these mountains their home, establishing one of the most ancient elven kingdoms in the known world.

#### Terrain

The Farlands feature:
- Extensive coastal forests
- Mountain territories (particularly Kelder)
- Plains including Tyror Miig and Tyror Weklis
- Notable woodlands: Butterfly Forest, Amholia Greras
- Hills marking regional borders: Painted Hills, Peleletra Hills

## Sandreach

### Geography

Sand Reach is the massive desert that stretches across the entire northern portion of Upoceax, extending all the way to the northern coast. This is one giant barren desert—a scorching expanse of sand, rock, and relentless heat.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The desert extends to the northern coast—there is no land north of Sand Reach
- **East**: Transitions to Sequestria (barren plains) and the Free Isles offshore
- **South**: The Sand Reach Mountains form the southern boundary
- **West**: Reaches toward the Seacleft Coast and Greenwater Sea

#### The Two Deserts

Sand Reach is divided into two major desert regions:

- **Mendari Desert**: The western portion of Sand Reach
- **Luquihn Desert**: The eastern portion, extending to the Salt Flats at its northeastern tip

#### Major Features

##### Belo Jenari

A large volcanic mountain rising from the center of the desert—a dramatic landmark visible for miles across the barren landscape.

##### Salt Flats

Located at the northeastern tip of Luquihn Desert, where the desert meets the coast.

#### Surrounding Waters and Regions

- **Greenwater Sea**: To the west, containing the island of Urok
- **Roule**: A halfling state north of Urok and north of Sand Reach
- **Free Isles**: Island cluster to the east
- **Sequestria (Siquestrya)**: Barren plains to the southeast, between Sand Reach and the coast

### Notable Regions

#### Sequestria (Siquestrya)

South of the Sandreach Desert and east of the Sandreach Mountains lies Sequestria—a plain savannah wasteland south and west of the Free Isles. North and west of this region rise the Lyagnadarr Mountains, home to Svorinthak the dragon.

Sequestria is home to warring centaur tribes engaged in constant posturing and attempts to assert dominance over each other. Each tribe is ruled by a chieftain who can be challenged by anyone willing to fight for the position. Combat follows mercy rules, and armor is rare—hard to make, slows you down, and inaccessible to most. Most warriors wield spears, bows, and scimitars.

The centaur tribes generally capture and sometimes kill visitors. They don't want anyone interfering with their way of life or their tribal conflicts.

### Notable Locations

#### Forever Beach

Sand makes perfect hourglass sand. Magical sand with all sorts of time-related properties. The beach causes you to age much faster though, and non-living things age even faster.

#### Breia

A state within the Sandreach desert, notable for its ancient ruins and dangerous magical sites.

##### Shtaneres

The ruins of an ancient city in Breia, built at the intersection of fire and air leylines. The city was destroyed long ago, its structures reduced to rubble by magical catastrophe.

###### Hermelia's Lair

Rising from the ruins of Shtaneres stands Hermelia's Lair—not a traditional dungeon but a tall sequence of connected spires reaching into the desert sky. This was the crypt and final home of Hermelia, a powerful mage who mastered both fire and air magic, granting her the ability to fly and rain down devastating fireballs on her enemies.

The spires are now inhabited by rocs—massive predatory birds that nest among the heights. At the core of the tallest spire runs a "spine" of concentrated fire magic, a pillar of flame that extends from base to peak. This spine stabilizes the entire structure, but it is also catastrophically dangerous—if the fire spine is broken or disrupted, the accumulated magical energy will detonate in a colossal explosion capable of leveling everything for miles around.

Treasure hunters brave enough to enter must contend with territorial rocs, navigate crumbling architecture hundreds of feet above the desert floor, and avoid damaging the fire spine at all costs.

### Belu Jenari

Tags: poi, volcano

A massive volcanic mountain rising from the center of the Sandreach desert—a dramatic landmark visible for miles across the barren landscape. This volcano was the site where the legendary Demon Horn of Fire was forged, drawing on the convergence of fire and light leylines beneath the mountain.

#### Temple of Bryn

Located in the foothills north of Belu Jenari, at the intersection of the fire and light leylines, the Temple of Bryn was once a magnificent structure dedicated to Bryn, the sun-god. The temple featured extremely bright eternal flames and a brilliant artificial sun at its center, channeling the raw elemental power of the leyline convergence.

The temple was destroyed during the formation of Belu Jenari itself—the volcanic eruption that created the mountain also devastated the temple, leaving only ruins. However, one artifact survived the cataclysm.

##### The Dawnbringer Stone

Within the ruins of the Temple of Bryn lies the Dawnbringer Stone, a sacred pedestal that holds Dawnbringer—a legendary sword forged from fire and light. The blade still rests in the stone, waiting for a worthy wielder who can withstand the searing heat and blinding radiance of the temple's remains.

## Free Isles

### Geography

The Free Isles region encompasses both the famous trading city-states and the mysterious island of Xabraedia. Positioned between Upoceax to the southwest and Aboyinzu to the east (via Devil's Spine), this region serves as a critical crossroads for maritime trade across Alaria.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: Bay of Merchants
- **East**: Devil's Spine passage leads to Chaal Nazzerox (Aboyinzu)
- **South**: Strait of Curses, Unsettling Bay
- **West**: Scaley Sea, Belter Bay; Upoceax beyond

#### The Free Isles Proper

The western cluster of city-states is what most people mean when they speak of "the Free Isles." These islands are populated by diverse peoples—Chargon, Nyolci, Eloweir, Swuigrach, Craven, Ayblek, Shapers, and Qord'ik. The cities are massive trading ports that have attracted merchants from all over the world.

The cities are extremely colorful, beautiful places, but deadly if you stick your nose where it doesn't belong. Huge coliseums have been built for gladiatorial fights. Best of all the gladiators is Red, the Screaming Blade.

#### Xabraedia

The large island east of the city-states, separated by The Spout (a common but not primary shipping lane). Xabraedia is not typically what people think of as "the Free Isles," but it falls within this region geographically.

Notable features:
- **Veluminatic Forest**: The purple-tinged forest covering much of the island
- **Starfall**: A giant pool of energy from a different plane—a major point of supernatural interest
- **Morgwood**: Forest region in the northern part of the island

#### Surrounding Waters

- **Bay of Merchants**: Northern waters, major trade route
- **The Spout**: Channel between the Free Isles and Xabraedia
- **Scaley Sea**: Southwestern waters
- **Belter Bay**: Southwest
- **Unsettling Bay**: Southern waters
- **Strait of Curses**: South of Xabraedia
- **Devil's Spine**: Eastern passage to Aboyinzu

#### Starfall

At the center of Xabraedia lies Starfall—a pool of intense, otherworldly energy unlike anything else on Alaria. The pool contains starblood, a substance that glows with a deep, alien purple-red color and twinkles with inner lights. This energy comes from a distant planar stack, having naturally coalesced here in a phenomenon that defies normal magical understanding.

The starblood is the remnant of a massive sky worm that escaped its home plane of Glyssen and came to Alaria, where it was promptly disintegrated by a coalition of titans. The creature's blood pooled here, barely contained on this plane. When removed from the pool, the substance begins teleporting back toward Glyssen—it cannot exist far from the pool's location.

Sometimes, people who enter the pool never come back, drawn into the alien energy or pulled toward the distant plane from which the starblood originates. The pool remains a site of mystery, danger, and otherworldly power.

### Yibiye

Tags: city, state, nation

The Yibeyen Gates consist of two colossal, moss-covered statues standing at the entrance to Yibiye's port. These ancient guardians are said to protect the city, and the stories are true—when Yibiye faces a credible threat, the statues come alive, defending the port with devastating power. Their mere presence serves as a warning to would-be attackers: Yibiye is not defenseless.

## Sandreach Mountains

### Geography

The Sand Reach Mountains are the vast central mountain range of Upoceax, positioned south of the Sand Reach desert. This is an extensive mountainous region containing several states and serving as the geographic heart of the continent.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Sand Reach desert
- **East**: Extends toward Sequestria and the eastern coast
- **South**: The Giant Lands and Wycendeula
- **West**: Intersects with the Kelder Mountains (the north-south range)

#### Relationship to Other Ranges

The Sand Reach Mountains bisect the Kelder Mountains where they meet on the western side—the Kelder running north-south, the Sand Reach running more or less east-west. This intersection creates a complex mountain junction in the western interior of Upoceax.

#### Climate Effect

The mountains act as a rain shadow, contributing to the desertification of the region to their north. They trap moisture on the southern side, leaving the northern Sand Reach desert parched and barren.

#### Terrain

The Sand Reach Mountains are an extensive system containing:
- Multiple distinct ranges and peaks
- Several states within the mountain territory
- Passes connecting the desert north to the forested south

The Giant Lands are characterized by hilly terrain—not as dramatic as the surrounding mountain ranges, but elevated and varied. The landscape provides ample territory for the giant populations to hunt, settle, and maintain their way of life.

#### Inhabitants

The region is home to various giant populations, including the Güli mountain giants who inhabit the Gül Mountains. Most giants here are relatively peaceful, subsisting on hunting megafauna and large oxen.

### Notable Locations

#### Enimogos

Giant helmet and battleaxe, likely used by the titans, that have never sunk into the ground. Would be troublesome if Hykravones got ahold of them.

#### Forges of Phlethagoros

Cyclops forges where 6 Cyclops rule together as joint owners, each specializing in a different skill. A huge mountain wall with magma flowing out—the Cyclops can wade straight through it unharmed. They can craft some of the best weapons in the world.

#### Gül Mountains

Composed of the Nygül, Egül, and Sorgül mountains. Inhabited by the Güli mountain giants. Mostly peaceful. Hunt the megafauna of Breidleheis and the large oxen in the more northern mountains.

Fylvrae Sylvrym is home to the largest group of Ulvsjael anywhere in the world. Nearly a dozen nomadic packs roam the forest, hunting and squabbling amongst themselves. Most time is spent in wolf form, though in times of extreme circumstance, councils are held in human form.

Rumors are that some of the packs have interbred with werewolves to expand their reach and power over the forest.

Beneath the forest lie hundreds of skystones, buried under a foot of tree roots and undergrowth. Super valuable, but venturing into the forest is dangerous.

The plains are completely overrun with satyrs. Random camps are everywhere, dotted with buffalo hide tents. The plains are quite fertile, but the satyr can't organize well enough to begin farming.

Despite having no government, rumors of a self-proclaimed king of the satyr have begun to spread. A satyr of dark and mysterious origins, with ambitions to unite all of the Satyr. These rumors terrify Balduahr, the much smaller dwarven kingdom in the southwest, which would have no hopes of defending itself if all of the satyr accross Wycenduala united.

## Venalthier

### Geography

Venalthier is the frozen polar region occupying the extreme southwest of Upoceax. This is a land of white cliffs, glacial ice, and bitter cold—a world apart from the forests and deserts of the main continent.

#### Boundaries and Position

- **North**: The Eceraen Mountains (running east-west) separate Venalthier from the Wycendeula forests
- **East**: The Sea of Daggers and its extension, the Frozen Sea
- **South**: Open polar ocean
- **West**: Dismar Deep, the southwestern ocean

#### Terrain

Venalthier is characterized by:
- White, ice-covered cliffs along much of its coastline
- Glaciated interior
- Polar conditions year-round

#### Isolation

Venalthier's position at the southern pole and its mountain barrier to the north make it one of the most isolated regions in Alaria. The Eceraen Mountains form a formidable wall between the frozen south and the relatively more hospitable Wycendeula forests.

#### Surrounding Seas

- **Dismar Deep**: The ocean to the southwest
- **Sea of Daggers / Frozen Sea**: The waters to the east, stretching along the entire southern coast of Upoceax

The first major face of cliffs in Venalthier, home to the Nabuhe dwarves who have carved extensive mining operations into the frozen stone.

#### Nabuhe Dwarves

A clan of dwarves adapted to the extreme cold of Venalthier, the Nabuhe have survived in this harsh environment by mining the unique resource that makes life possible in the frozen wastes.

#### Frostfire Mines

Deep within East Whitewall, the Nabuhe mine Frostfire—a miraculous material that burns from within, emitting warmth without consuming fuel. This is the only reliable source of heat for the dwarves in the southern frozen regions, making it more valuable than gold or gems.

However, Frostfire possesses a darker property: it has immense power to control people's fear. Those who wield Frostfire can manipulate the primal terror in others' hearts, granting them formidable abilities of psychological manipulation. This dual nature—life-giving warmth and mind-controlling power—makes Frostfire both essential and dangerous. The Nabuhe guard their monopoly on this resource jealously, knowing that losing control of the Frostfire trade would mean losing their survival advantage in Venalthier's brutal climate.
