## Aether

Tags: material

Aether is the primary meta-fluid source of energy on Lanthornia—a nearby planar stack. An eruption on lanthornia caused a sizable quantity of aether and lanthornium to be expelled from the planar stack and land in Alaria.

Some creatures of Alaria have some sensitivity to the material and can manipulate it and pull it out of the air. Aether is used to power sky ships and a number of other machines and contraptions.

Raw Aether spends most of it's time in the air—inert, invisible, and immaterial. However, it can be extracted and processed with a little water, turning it into a powerful fuel. On contact with a purified lanthornium vibrating at a specific frequency, the aether will begin to expand, losing it's bond with the water and becoming non-substantive once more. There are many similarities to a steam engine. Aether engines frequently involve lanthornium plates being struck to start, causing an self-striking process to continue feeding more aether and lanthornium strikes. 

### Lanthornium

An uncommon, gray-blue type of stone that requires some expensive processing to purify.

## Diamonds

Tags: material

Diamonds are quite rare on Alaria. Small ones can be found at the surface, but the biggest ones lie deep undergound—miles, and miles underground—in caves and underground reservoirs. Extremely dangerous to retrieve—there are a lot of creatures (and natural hazards) deep underground.

## Honygar

Tags: material

Also known as hardstone.

## Red Gold

Tags: mineral

Red gold is one of the most valuable materials known on Alaria. The metal is a beautiful reddish gold color that never tarnishes, is extremely reflective, and is heavier than normal gold.

## Sky-stone

Tags: material

Sky-stones are stones that have broken off from the lower crust of the Astral Plane, usually during its incredibly powerful earthquakes. 

The stones generally plummet quite a ways before the buoyency they experience in the Material Plane cuases them to float back up—usually not before smashing into the ground first though. Low density (density means the opposite here—it's the density of the "floaty" substance per weight of stone) stones float lower to the ground, while higher density ones can reach as high as the stars themselves (and are often populated by Xaphriel).

## Songsilk

Tags: material

A combination of whale blood and baleen, this silk has amplifying or dampenging effects on emotion. It attunes the wearer with the whale's melody, which can be one of sadness, triumph, joy, or anything else.

## Twyl

Tags: material

Twyl is a magical crystal that produces oxygen with no apparent energy input. The production of the oxygen is tied to the phase and movements of the moons.
