## Aether

Tags: material

Aether is the primary meta-fluid source of energy on Lanthornia—a nearby planar stack. An eruption on lanthornia caused a sizable quantity of aether and lanthornium to be expelled from the planar stack and land in Alaria.

Some creatures of Alaria have some sensitivity to the material and can manipulate it and pull it out of the air. Aether is used to power sky ships and a number of other machines and contraptions.

Raw Aether spends most of it's time in the air—inert, invisible, and immaterial. However, it can be extracted and processed with a little water, turning it into a powerful fuel. On contact with a purified lanthornium vibrating at a specific frequency, the aether will begin to expand, losing it's bond with the water and becoming non-substantive once more. There are many similarities to a steam engine. Aether engines frequently involve lanthornium plates being struck to start, causing an self-striking process to continue feeding more aether and lanthornium strikes. 

### Lanthornium

An uncommon, gray-blue type of stone that requires some expensive processing to purify.

## Diamonds

Tags: material

Diamonds are quite rare on Alaria. Small ones can be found at the surface, but the biggest ones lie deep undergound—miles, and miles underground—in caves and underground reservoirs. Extremely dangerous to retrieve—there are a lot of creatures (and natural hazards) deep underground.

## Honygar

Tags: material

Also known as hardstone.

## Red Gold

Tags: mineral

Red gold is one of the most valuable materials known on Alaria. The metal is a beautiful reddish gold color that never tarnishes, is extremely reflective, and is heavier than normal gold.

## Sky-stone

Tags: material

Sky-stones are stones that have broken off from the lower crust of the Astral Plane, usually during its incredibly powerful earthquakes. 

The stones generally plummet quite a ways before the buoyency they experience in the Material Plane cuases them to float back up—usually not before smashing into the ground first though. Low density (density means the opposite here—it's the density of the "floaty" substance per weight of stone) stones float lower to the ground, while higher density ones can reach as high as the stars themselves (and are often populated by Xaphriel).

## Songsilk

Tags: material

A combination of whale blood and baleen, this silk has amplifying or dampenging effects on emotion. It attunes the wearer with the whale's melody, which can be one of sadness, triumph, joy, or anything else.

## Titan Blood & Bones

Tags: materials, magic, deoric

The blood and bones of the titans are among the rarest and most valuable substances in Alaria. They are the only known materials capable of holding Deoric charge—the reality-warping power of the language of creation.

### Origins

The titans were the first beings created by Azus, 235 million years ago. They were cosmic entities of pure structure and will, powered by Deoric itself rather than by soul and shadow. When the Ezz Rift flooded Alaria with Melera's music 120 million years ago, most titans experienced emotion for the first time—an agony they had no framework to process. Many killed themselves. Others fled to distant planar stacks across the cosmos.

The bodies that remain are the source of all titan blood and titan bone used today.

### Physical Properties

**Titan Blood**

In its natural state, titan blood has long since dried into a dark red substance resembling dirt or powder. It can be found in deposits where titan bodies fell—sometimes layered into the earth, sometimes concentrated in caverns where the corpses came to rest.

When hydrated, titan blood reconstitutes into a shimmering crimson liquid that looks disturbingly like fresh blood. This reconstituted form is what's used for handmagic tattooing and Deoric ink.

**Titan Bones**

Unlike the blood, titan bones have not decayed at all. They remain exactly as they were when the titans died—enormous, pale structures of impossible hardness. Special tools are required to grind them down; ordinary steel cannot scratch the surface.

Ground titan bone can be mixed into a paste that functions identically to titan blood for handmagic purposes.

### Why Titan Materials Work

Titans were cosmic beings whose very existence was bound to Aurus and Nydus. Their blood and bones still resonate with those frequencies—they vibrate in harmony with the sources of soul and shadow in ways no mortal substance can.

This resonance allows titan materials to act as a buffer for Deoric power. When Deoric runes are inscribed in titan blood, the blood holds the charge without disintegrating, creating stable anchor points that can channel reality-warping force through a mortal's threads without immediately tearing them apart.

Nothing else works. No mortal blood, no alchemical substitute, no synthetic compound can replicate this cosmic resonance.

### Uses

**Handmagic**: Titan blood or bone paste is used to tattoo Deoric runes onto the back of the hands. The runes are activated through specific hand articulations.

**Deoric Ink**: Titan materials can be processed into ink for recording Deoric text. Writing Deoric is magically draining—each rune or simple command takes about an hour to inscribe and costs the scribe 10 hitpoints, recovered at only 1 hitpoint per week. Once Deoric text is read by anyone other than the author, it disintegrates into ash.

**Ritual Components**: Some Deoric rituals require titan blood as a component, though the sacrifice of mortal life remains the primary power source.

### Sources & Scarcity

The vast majority of titan bones come from Deo Esari, a mountain kingdom built atop the ruins of ancient titan cities. The mountains there contain massive titan skeletons that have been harvested for centuries. Deo Esari supplies roughly 95% of the world's titan bone.

This monopoly is weakening—not because of competition, but because the supply is finite. Abandoned quarries dot the hills where veins have run dry. Prices climb year by year.

### The Black Market

Desperation breeds grim commerce. Every handmagic tattoo contains titan blood or bone—which means every handmagic user carries valuable material in their skin.

Body harvesting exists. Practitioners are murdered and their tattooed skin flayed to reclaim the titan materials, which can then be processed and reused. This trade is illegal in most civilized nations, but where titan bone prices spike, the murders follow.

### Dragon Blood: A False Substitute

Unscrupulous merchants sometimes sell "dragon blood" as a cheaper alternative to titan materials. This is snake oil.

Dragon blood does cause visible changes when tattooed—skin discoloration, heightened aggression, mild hallucinations, and other effects depending on the dragon's elemental nature. Buyers attribute these symptoms to "the magic working."

It is not working. Dragon blood cannot hold Deoric charge. It does not resonate with Aurus and Nydus. The runes inscribed in dragon blood are just ink. Any "handmagic" activated this way is placebo and poison—and the buyer walks away convinced they got a bargain while their threads remain exactly as weak as before.

## Twyl

Twyl is a magical crystal that produces oxygen with no apparent energy input. The production of the oxygen is tied to the phase and movements of the moons.
