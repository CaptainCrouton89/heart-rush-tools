## Introduction

Heart Rush is a crunchy, fantasy TTRPG ruleset.
And it does combat really well.
Here’s how Heart Rush compares to the average
fantasy TTRPG:

**- Crunchy**. There aren’t tons of tables, and the
math isn’t too bad, but this is far from “rules-lite”.

- **It’s grittier and more simulationist**. Healing
  is slow, and fighting is dangerous. You probably
  won't die, but it’ll feel like you’re going to.
- **Each round of combat is unique**. The core
  mechanics of combat discourage being predictable.
  This is a cornerstone of the Heart Rush rules.
  **- Fast, tactical combat. Seriously**. You’ve got
  lots of important decisions to make each round,
  and it doesn’t slow down the game since
  everyone’s making decisions in parallel.
  **- Highly cooperative**. Each class is designed to
  be played with the other classes, and will be best at
  allowing the other classes to shine. Everyone feels
  special.
- **You’ll feel heroic eventually, but not for a
  while**. And when you do, it’s mainly because
  you’ve done really difficult things, not because
  you have heroic abilities.
  **- Constant leveling**. You don't have to wait for
  the level up—spend XP on a variety of stuff at
  different costs to improve your character.
  **- Wild character design.** A barbarian wizard,
  ninja detective, or fire-bender assassin are all
  totally viable builds.
  **- Extremely flexible trait system**. Plain English
  descriptions of your character result in mechanical
  bonuses and concrete hooks that drive the story
  forward.
  **- Hyper-flexible elemental magic**. For example,
  you can be an air-bender and do all the things you
  should be able to do as an air-bender. And it's not
  tied to any class, so you can tack that onto
  whatever type of build you want.
  **- Fail-forward mechanics**. The story won’t
  always grind to a halt on failures.

```
Origin of the Name
When initial rounds of feedback on the
rules came in, people derided the game as a
“heartbreaker”—a term in the TTRPG design
community given to games into which their
authors pour their hearts, only to have fail since
the games don’t differentiate themselves
enough from D&D. And it was fair—these
rules originally stemmed from my frustrations
with D&D; I had wanted to make a game that
was essentially D&D, but just better at doing it
than D&D itself. Of course, that’s not possible,
and I was rightly made fun of.
However, Heart Rush has come a long way
since then. It still has some overlapping design
goals, but there are major differences. It relies
more on skillful GMs. It’s much grittier. And
it’s got more tactical combat that is frequently
extremely tense, and can feel very terrifying.
It’s a rush.
And thus, the name was born. Yes, this
game was, and to some degree always will be,
a little bit of a heartbreaker. But also, no game
gets my heart pumping in the same way. And
thus: Heart Rush.
```

I’m a GM...

Why Should I Run This?

Heart Rush is probably not going to feel that
different to run compared to most crunchy fantasy
TTRPGs. However, it does try to balance the crunch
with more narrative-forward elements. The two I
want to highlight are the aspect system, and the skill
check complications.
With aspects, players will describe their character
in plain English. The mechanics will incentivize
them to have both positive and negative descriptions,
and then to actually RP them out in play. As the GM,
you don’t have to keep track of your players and
their flaws and reward them when they’re good;
they’ll let you know exactly when, and they will go
out of their way to complicate the story in a way

```
appropriate to their character, because doing so is the
only way they can use the positive sides of their
aspects. The system is self balancing, and places the
vast majority of the work on the players themselves.
The end result is players helping you tell a more
interesting story.
Complications are a mechanic that come in to
play when players are making skill checks. When
they roll, they sometimes have the chance to replace
a bad roll with a better roll that has negative,
unrelated side effects. Those negative, unrelated side
effects are up to you to decide, but in my experience
they’re quite easy to come up with. When the players
have voluntarily chosen to take a complication, it’s a
golden ticket for you to make the situation worse in
the most narratively satisfying way, without players
feeling like it’s unfair.
```

```
Heart Rush Combat
Heart Rush is a highly specialized combat machine. Sure, it’s got enough framework to handle all of
the noncombatant stuff, but when combat begins is when its engine purrs to life and you see Heart Rush
take off.
This was intentional—both the specialization, and lack of great depth out of combat. From my
experience, most fun that happens outside of combat isn’t due to great mechanics, but due to how the
story unfolds, and the interactions with NPCs. These things are very dependent on who the GM is and
how they want to run it, and I didn’t want to get in the way of that. Talk more, roll less is a motto I stand
behind. However, when it comes to combat, having that framework matters. Combat has high stakes,
every maneuver makes a difference, and everyone has different but potentially equally high impact on it,
second by second. I don’t think that argument can be made for the other pillars of a fantasy adventure. For
this reason, combat rules got special privileges. I didn’t want them to merely facilitate the fiction—I
wanted them to be thrilling, cooperative, and exciting. So that’s what I did.
While designing the rules, I had to make sure they passed the blank-room combat test. This is a test
where you run combat in which none of the combatants have abilities, and there’s no terrain. In many
games, this can be a disaster—those are core features. However, I believe they’re both crutches. First,
relying on fun abilities scratches only one kind of itch, and it’s something that any game can employ.
Second, using terrain places the onus on the GM to make the combat fun, rather than the rules themselves.
If the combat is still fun without either of those things, it means that those rules are solid. That’s what
makes Heart Rush special.
```

I’m a Player...

Why Should I Play?

This game is for people who like combat and
mechanics and getting into the weeds of character
design and optimization. Heart Rush has other stuff
going on too, but if you actively _don’t_ like those
things, you’ll be missing out on a lot of what Heart
Rush has to offer. As a quick list, you will like Heart
Rush if...

- You like making a smart tactical play, but hate
  having to wait five minutes every round to do so.
- You like spending hours theory crafting strange
  character concepts that actually work.
- You like coordinating with your allies and
  dunking on enemies through the power of synergy.
- You like roleplaying flaws in your character,
  but want to get mechanically rewarded for it in
  gameplay.
- You want to mix and match fantasy character
  tropes to make your own, creative archetypes.
- You like grittier settings with crunch.
  Heart Rush isn’t the perfect solution for every
  desire in a TTRPG. But it’s a damn good one for
  some of them.

```
Te a m F ig h t He ro G a me s
A core inspiration for Heart Rush came
from team fighting video games. In these
games, each team has a squad of players with
their own specializations, and then the teams
would duke it out and eventually one prevails.
One of things that stood out to me about
these games was how important it was for a
solid team composition. If the team was
missing someone of a certain role, the entire
team fell apart. Players weren’t prioritizing
maximizing their damage, they were
prioritizing their ability to perform their
specific role. That was very appealing to me—
people like feeling like they’re the best, and
everyone can be the best when they’re all
trying to be the best at something different.
Although many tactical TTRPGs have
some concept of different roles and combat
specialization, I’ve felt they were somewhat
weak, and more thematic than functional. I
wanted to change that. In Heart Rush, there are
only three core classes—tanks, damage, and
support. You can layer a bunch of flavor and
additional mechanics on top of them, but those
classes form a foundation for your character.
This framework let me build a system where
each class is vastly benefited by having the
other classes present, and will vastly benefit
them in turn. Everyone feels extremely
valuable, even if they haven’t min-maxed to the
same degree as another player.

## Building Your Char acter

As you make a character in Heart Rush,
remember that at the center of every Heart Rush
character is their heart. It is the foundation on which
you build your life, your soul; it is the chassis and
essence of your decisions and their consequences;
and it is what drives you forward. You are building
an entire, fictional person. Make them awesome.

You r D r e a m

With this in mind, build a character that has a
vision towards what they want to achieve. You
should have a dream of what you want to do in the
world, one that is complex and difficult and worthy
of the caliber of legend you wish to become.
Remember—you determine the direction the story
takes. There’s no goal to this game besides the one
you set for yourself. So speak with your GM about
the world in which the game takes place, and figure
out how you want to be remembered. It’s your story,
and the stakes are low, so it’s okay to set your sights
high.
Once you have come up with something, write
this dream down somewhere. You may want to edit
or add to it later.

You r V i t al s

These are the core-most stats of your character.
They represent the raw capabilities and limits of
your mind and body.

```
Experience
When the game begins, you will start with some
experience (XP). During the game and between
sessions, you may spend XP to gain new skills,
abilities, and more. See the Spending Experience
section to learn more. After making your character,
you may begin spending your XP.
```

```
Ability Dice
Players have four important stats—might, agility,
cunning, and presence. These traits define your
physical and mental abilities, and are used to
determine the outcomes of nearly any difficult task
you attempt to do.
```

```
Might
Might is your strength, endurance, and fortitude.
High might allows you to push through locked doors,
lift heavy gates, resist poison, and run for miles
without rest.
```

```
Agilit y
Agility is your physical dexterity, speed, and
reflexes. High agility allows you to dodge falling
rocks, respond to threats faster, and perform a
summersault on a tightrope.
```

```
Cunning
Cunning is your intellect, wisdom, and senses.
High cunning allows you to recall information
you’ve learned, notice the nearly imperceptible, and
discern fact from fiction.
```

Presence

Presence is your charm, charisma, and social
influence. High presence allows you to persuade
guards to let you past, lie to them about why you did
it, and then intimidate them into not telling anyone
about it.

Assigning Dice to Your Core Stats

Your prowess in each of these abilities is
represented by a die. Whenever you attempt a task
that requires one of these abilities, you will roll the
ability’s corresponding die and add it to the result.
The first step in creating your character is
determining which dice you will use for which stat.
Typical humanoids use d6s and d4s for each ability,
reflecting a general mediocrity at most things. When
you create your character, assign a d6 to two of your
abilities, and a d4 to the remaining two.

Movement

By default, you have a 60 feet move speed. That
means that when you take the dash action (see the
Combat section), you can cover that distance. Note
that your move speed is negatively effected by
equipment penalties (like armor).
When swimming, you have a swim speed of 15
feet. This is also negatively effected by equipment
penalties: don’t swim with heavy armor on.
When climbing, your move speed is 5 feet. This
is not affected by equipment penalties.

Health

The health of your character is represented by a
combination of your hit points, heart die, and
wounds. In combat, you will lose hit points and take
wounds. As you exert yourself, your heart die will
fall, making it harder to avoid losing hit points and
taking more wounds. Eventually, if you take too

```
many wounds, you may bleed out and die. Each of
these systems will be explained further in the
following sections.
```

```
Hit Points
Hit points represent your physical health.
Damage causes your hit points to fall by a
corresponding amount. As they fall, you come closer
to death. When you create a character, you start at 40
hit points. If your hit points ever reach 0, you can
choose to immediately go unconscious. If you don’t,
you go unconscious after 10 minutes if your hit
points are still at 0.
Your hit points can go negative as well. If your
hit points are ever equal to the negative equivalent of
your maximum hit points, you die.
When you take a long rest, your hit points return
to their maximum.
```

```
Heart Die
Your heart die represents your stamina. It
manifests itself when you roll dice to perform
challenging actions. With very few exceptions, this
die will be part of every roll you make. When you
create a character, it starts at a maximum of a d8.
Other creatures can have larger or smaller heart
dice. A rat, for example, will only have a d4 heart
die, while an adult dragon would use a d20. It is
possible to increase your own heart die beyond a d8,
but it requires a lot of XP and is challenging.
Sometimes, there will be effects that cause your
heart die to increase or decrease. This means
replacing your heart die with a die of a larger or
smaller size. For example, decreasing your heart die
from a d8 would mean replacing it with a d6.
```

```
Wou n ds
When you take damage in Heart Rush, it can
mean different things depending on how much
damage you take. If it’s less than 10 damage, this
```

### BUILDING YOUR CHARACTER

represents minor injuries—nothing that poses a real
threat. However, if you take 10 or more damage, this
represents something serious—a wound. The exact
details of taking wounds and healing them will be
described later in the Combat section.

Your Niche

Kin & Culture

Everyone comes from a different background and
has a different upbringing. When you create a
character, choose a race from the Kin & Culture
section. You gain the aspects and abilities that come
from choosing that race.
Many races have multiple heritages within that
race. In that case, you gain the aspects and abilities
of the race, as well as a those of a chosen heritage.

Ta l e n t s

Talents are specialized abilities that you know
and can utilize. These act as a way of specializing
your play style and differentiating you from anyone
else in the world. Although you do not start with any
talents, they can be purchased with XP, with which
you start the game and can immediately use to buy
talents.

Background

Your background describes your past life and
skills. Choose up to three professions and distribute
4 ranks between them. They can all be in one, or
they can be spread between them. Whenever you
make a skill check that one or more of your
professions would apply to, add your rank in the
relevant professions to that roll.

```
Aspects
For every facet of your character that cannot be
described with abilities and skills, they can be
described with aspects. Your aspects describe the
features and traits from your personality,
background, and experiences that make you distinct
—both positive and negative.
When you first create your character, you gain
three destiny points (DP). You will gain and lose DP
each session as you spend them to benefit from your
positive aspects and gain them by letting your
negative ones shine through. If you ever start a
session with fewer than three DP, you instead start
with three DP. You cannot have more than 10 DP.
As you play your character, you will gather more
aspects, and their impact will grow. Each aspect has
two parts: its description, and its rank.
```

```
Description
The description describes the aspect as a whole,
and should be a phrase or a few words to describe
your character. It should be a significant personality
trait, behavioral quirk, belief, ideal, self-proclaimed
title, or some sort of reputation. For example,
“Bullheaded,” “Record everything,” “Chronic
headaches,” “Kleptomaniac,” “Fortune teller,”
“Leave no one behind,” “I fear nothing,” “I can see
straight into your soul” and “I want revenge for my
father” can all be aspect descriptions. Do not choose
generic things, like “good at most thing” or “lucky”,
```

```
Example
Let’s say you choose “Diplomat” and “Tutor
for Nobility” as your professions, and distribute 3
ranks to the first, and 1 rank to the latter. If you
were making a skill check to persuade someone of
something, you could add 3 to that roll due to your
background as a diplomat.
```

since they will apply to everything, or be too vague
to decide if they should apply to a situation. If the
GM says your aspect description is too generic, you
need to choose a new one, or make it more specific.

Rank

Next, the aspect gets a rank. The rank of an
aspect represents how influential that aspect is over
who you are, and will determine the modifier to your
rolls. The rank will be a number between one and
five, though in some cases it can be increased even
further.

Using Your Aspect for Bonuses

By spending destiny points up to or equal to an
aspect’s rank, you may add that much to any skill
check. In order to use this, whatever roll you are
making must align with the meaning of your aspect,
as approved by the GM.
For example, if you had the aspect “Leave no
one behind” at rank two, and you were trying to save
a friend stuck in prison, you could spend two DP and
add 2 to a die roll made to break open the bars of the
cell.
Or, for example, if you had the aspect “I want
revenge for my father” at rank four, you could spend
four DP and add 4 to any skill check that was related
to getting revenge for your father.
If you have multiple aspects that apply to a roll,
use only the highest ranking aspect that applies.

Using Your Aspect for Destiny Points

In contrast, if an aspect would complicate a
situation or indicate you were bad at something, you
may choose to do whatever your aspect would
suggest and gain destiny points equal to the aspect’s
rank.
“Bum leg,” “Kleptomaniac,” and “Quick to draw
my sword” are examples of negative aspects. If you
role-play an aspect such that you invite risk, then the

```
GM will award DP. For example, if a bookstore
owner insults you, and you have the aspect “Quick to
draw my sword” at rank three, you would gain three
DP by drawing your sword and threatening the shop-
owner.
Likewise, if you were chasing after a fleeing
thief, rather than making a skill check to keep up
with them, you could choose to fail the roll, citing
your bum leg and taking DP corresponding to the
rank of the aspect.
```

```
Creating Your Aspects
When you create your character, create two
aspects. You will gain two more from your race and
culture and you may gain more throughout the game.
All aspects start at rank one when they are created,
unless noted otherwise. No aspect can be greater
than rank five.
When creating an aspect, it is generally a good
idea to have aspects with both positive and negative
sides to them. Without any negative aspects, you
have no way of gaining more destiny points, and
therefore cannot spend them on bonuses. Also look
out for aspects that can be both positive and negative
```

### BUILDING YOUR CHARACTER

```
Example
Let’s say you have the aspects “Diplomat” at
rank 2, and “I need revenge for my family” at
rank 3. You have just met the queen and are
trying to convince her that civil war is imminent.
When you make the skill check to convince her
of this truth, you spend 3 DP to increase your roll
by 3, successfully convincing her. However,
moments later you find out that the queen herself
was complicit in your family’s murders. The GM
invokes you aspect for revenge—you gain 2 DP,
but must now exact revenge, or else be forced to
pay 2 DP instead.
```

aspects. For example, “Kleptomaniac" could be used
as a bonus to rolls to steal, but you could gain DP for
invoking it at times when it really would be best _not_
to steal. You could even use both at the same time—
such as when stealing something you shouldn’t.
You’d gain DP when you decide to try to steal it, but
then could immediately spend the same amount to
gain a bonus on taking it.

Wou n ds

When you take wounds, they will have a
description and a rank, just like an aspect. You may
use wounds as aspects as well, though you cannot
gain more than 5 DP from invoking the wound, even
if the rank of the wound is higher. For example, if
you have the rank 12 wound, "Guts spilling out,”
you could gain 5 DP by taking a minus 12 penalty to
nearly any athletics check, since it'd be logical that
having that type of wound would make it very
difficult to do almost anything physical.

Progress

```
There are six different ranks of combat power
you can start at in Heart Rush. With each rank, you
have access to more combat abilities. When you first
start to play, everyone should agree which rank to
begin the game at. At rank 1, players are barely more
than commoners with a desire for excitement; at rank
4, players are incredible combatants, likely known
throughout their community; and at rank 6 and
beyond, players are at low heroic levels; with
everything else falling somewhere in between.
```

```
At each rank, you gain new abilities. If you are
starting at a rank higher than rank 1, gain all the
abilities from each previous rank, and start with XP
equal to the corresponding value in the row.
```

Combat Ranks, Classes,

```
Subcl asses, & Paragon Levels
While you will gain XP every session, you
progress in combat ranks at the GM’s discretion. In
general, you should expect to graduate to the next
combat rank around when you have an amount of
total XP corresponding to the respective rank, as
```

```
Stages of Progression
Rank Abilities Starting XP
0 None 5
1 Some class abilities 15
2 Class and subclass
abilities
```

### 30

```
3 More subclass abilities 50
4 Even more subclass
abilities
```

### 80

```
5+ A paragon ability per
rank beyond
```

```
120 + 40 per
level
```

```
Advanced Character Creation
Sometimes, you want an even more in-
depth character creation process. If this is
something that interests everyone in the group,
check out the advanced character creation rules
in the Advanced Character Creation section.
```

```
Burn Through Those DP
To get the most out of your character, you
should be invoking your aspects frequently. DP
are not meant to be a precious resource—spend
them, and then make more by invoking your
negative ones. When creating your character,
make sure to create aspects that you’re going to
enjoy using; you’ll be using them a lot.
```

outlined in the table above. However, it is ultimately
up to the GM.

Rank 0

At this rank, you have no special abilities beyond
those that you purchase with your XP.

Rank 1

When you reach rank 1, you will have to choose
a class, as listed in the Classes section. Your class
will determine what role you have in combat—
tanking heavy blows, dealing damage, or supporting
your teammates. You are welcome to do whatever
you want in combat, but your class will give you an
edge in its respective role. Mark down all of the
abilities for that class that are at or below rank 1.

Rank 2

Upon reaching rank 2, you will have to choose a
subclass. Each class has a few subclasses, which are
specializations of your class. You must choose one of
them. Mark down all of the abilities for your class
and subclass that are at or below rank 2.
Additionally, at this stage you must decide if you
wish to become spelltouched. Spelltouched are a
universal subclass specializing in using elements to
deal damage. You can read more about them in the
Spelltouched section.

```
Rank 3
When you reach rank 3, you unlock more
abilities in your subclass. Mark down all of the
abilities for your subclass that are at or below rank 3.
```

```
Rank 4
At rank 4, you unlock the last abilities from your
subclass. Mark down all of the abilities for your
subclass that are at or below rank 4.
```

```
Rank 5 and Above
Finally, upon reaching rank 5, and for each rank
thereafter, you gain a paragon level. When you gain
```

```
a paragon level, you may choose and gain an ability
from the Paragon Abilities section. These abilities
represent heroic level capstones to various combat
archetypes.
```

### BUILDING YOUR CHARACTER

```
Advice for New Groups
If everyone in your group is brand new to
Heart Rush, rank 0 is a good place to start.
There are many rules that only kick into play
once you have a class, and Heart Rush combat
can take some time to wrap your head around,
so it can be nice to start small.
```

```
GM Note
When determining when to grant players the
next combat rank, it’s generally a good idea to
wait until a suitably impressive fight has been
won by the party. These combat ranks are major
upgrades in player combat power, so they act as a
great reward for players accepting and defeating
more dangerous fights.
```

## Gameplay Basics

This section describes how general gameplay
should proceed.

Rolling Dice

Skill Checks

Whenever you attempt to do something that has a
realistic chance of failure, the GM may ask you to
roll a skill check to see if you succeed. Whenever
you roll a skill check, there are two dice you need to
roll—your heart die, and one of your ability dice.
The ability die should correspond to the activity you
are doing. For example, if you are lifting something
heavy, you should use your might die.
After rolling the dice, calculate the sum, and then
add any modifiers you may gain from your aspects
or other bonuses. If the sum of the dice is equal to or
higher than the GM’s predetermined challenge
number (CN), then you succeed.

Difficulties

The GM should use the following chart to set the
challenge number.

```
Complications
As your heart leads you through your life and
story, there may be times that it stutters. When it
does, you may fail at whatever you are doing, or
something else may go wrong. This is represented by
rolling a 1 on a skill check.
Whenever you make a skill check, if the result
on one of the dice is a 1, you must choose to either
automatically fail the check, or else you may re-roll
that die, using the new result. If you choose the
latter, a complication occurs. A complication does
not mean you fail to do what you were trying to do—
```

```
Challenge Number
```

```
CN Difficulty
```

```
Skill level
```

```
Lo w High v. High
```

```
6 Fairly Easy 79% 95% 100%
9 Average 44% 77% 93%
12 Hard 13% 44% 74%
```

```
15 Very Hard – 16% 45%
18 Nearly
Impossible
```

### – 2% 19%

```
21 Heroic – – 4%
```

```
The percentages in the cells correspond to the chance of success for a
typical human at full heart with low (d8+d6), high (d8+d8+2), and
very high(d8+d10+4) skill level. Note that players can eventually reach
up to d12+d20+10, and that this chart does not account for
complications.
```

```
Example
You are trying to climb around the edge of the
king’s tower without falling to your death. You
have to make a skill check and roll a 1 and a 5.
You really don’t want to fall, so you accept a
complication and re-roll the 1, getting a 4 instead.
The 9 is apparently high enough and you succeed
at climbing around the tower, but the GM
announces that in a near fall, you accidentally
knock a stone down, alerting the guards below.
```

use the total result after re-rolling your dice to
determine that. Instead, something related to the task
at hand but not determinate of your success or failure
goes wrong. This can be many things, such as
breaking your lock picks if you were trying to open a
door, or sparking a new line of interrogation if you
were trying to smooth talk your way past guards.
If you roll additional 1s they do not cause
complications.
If you roll two 1s as your first roll, you fail the
check, and there is a complication.

Raising the Stakes

Whenever you or another player makes a skill
check, but before the dice are rolled, you may choose
to raise the stakes. When you raise the stakes, you
increase the effectiveness of a success, and the
increase how disastrous the complication or failure is
on a fail. You may do this once once per session, on
any roll that any player makes.

Saving Throws

Whenever you have to roll to avoid or mitigate
the effects of someone else’s action, such as dodging
a falling boulder, or withstanding a powerful venom,
make a saving throw. Saving throws are identical to
skill checks, except they do not provoke
complications. Instead, rolling equal to or over the
challenge number implies you avoid the negative
effect, and rolling under implies suffering the
negative effect.
When the effect was created by another creature,
they are usually made against that creature’s ability
challenge number. If it was an effect from the
environment, the CN will be determined by the GM.

Ability Challenge Number

When another creature is avoiding an effect that
you have caused, the GM may have them roll a

```
saving throw. The CN for this roll is equal to the
maximum of your most applicable ability die, plus
two times your paragon level (which starts at zero).
This number is generically called your ability
challenge number, though more specifically, you
would have might, agility, cunning, presence, and
even heart challenge numbers. Use whichever ability
is most relevant for the roll, or if no ability die fits—
such as the case with magical effects—use your heart
challenge number—the maximum of your heart die
instead.
```

```
At tack & Defense Rolls
Attack and defense rolls, or A/D rolls, are made
whenever your roll to deal or negate damage in an
engagement or opportunity attack. Roll the relevant
ability die, your heart die, and add any necessary
modifiers. A/D rolls are explained in greater detail in
the Combat chapter.
```

```
Advantage & Disadvantage
Advantage and disadvantage give you bonuses or
penalties to a roll. For each instance of advantage
you have on a roll, roll an additional instance of the
lowest of the dice, and then remove the lowest result
when calculating the total. When rolling with
disadvantage, instead roll an additional instance of
the highest of the dice, and then remove the highest
result from the dice you rolled. Advantage and
disadvantage cancel out, and multiple instances of
either one can stack.
Multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage are
referred to as Ax or Dx, where 'x' indicates the
number of instances. When determining the outcome
with advantage or disadvantage, treat the final result
as if only the dice that were kept were rolled. For
instance, if you have an ability that activates when a
specific number is rolled, disregard the results from
```

### GAMEPLAY BASICS

the extra dice gained through advantage or
disadvantage, and consider only the results of the
retained dice.

Helping

When someone wishes to assist another person
with a skill check, they can choose to help. If you are
in combat, this requires your action. Helping grants
the person making the check advantage, so long as
you reasonably could provide help in that situation.
If you help someone, you are both liable to suffer
any consequences from any complications or
failures.

Group Rolls

Sometimes, everyone in a group will need to
make the same check, or will want to help on the
same check. For example, working together to break
down a door, sneaking past some guards, or
persuading a judge could all be group rolls. Rolls are
calculated differently, depending on the exact type of
task.
If everyone is making a check where the group is
only as strong as the weakest link, such as sneaking
past guards as a group, only one person rolls. Find
the person in the group who is the worst at making
this roll, and they make the roll for the group with
advantage. It is assumed that everyone else will

```
succeed, but if this person fails, everyone else may
fail as well.
However, if it is a task where people work
together, such as when everyone works together to
convince someone of the truth, then only the person
best at the task has to roll, and they may roll with
advantage.
```

Using Abilities

```
When creating your character, you will inevitably
gain a lot of abilities. Abilities are any chunk of rules
that let you create an affect, perform some activity,
or do anything at all. Examples include class
abilities, racial abilities, talents, and paragon levels,
though some abilities grant you their own abilities.
You can most easily recognize an ability because
of the format it has in this book:
```

```
Ability Name
Ability tags.
Rules text describing what the ability lets you do.
```

```
All abilities listed in this rulebook have their
name, followed by tags, and then followed by their
rules. For the most part, abilities can be used
whenever you want. However, some have
restrictions, usually listed in their tags, or if it's very
specific, in the ability rules itself.
All tags in an ability are separated by periods.
Each tag will contain information about when you
can use the ability, or what prerequisites there are for
gaining that ability. While many tags will be
explained by whichever section they appear in, there
are a few types which can show up on any type of
ability. These are listed below.
```

```
Example
You are trying to lift a heavy portcullis. Due
to various elements at play, you have three
sources of advantage, and one source of
disadvantage. Your might die is a d6, and your
heart die is a d8. When you make the roll, you
would roll with 2 levels of advantage—1d8 and
3d6. Lets say you get an 3, 6, 5, and 1,
respectively. The final result would be 11 (6 + 5).
```

Frequency Tags

The frequency of an ability determines how often
it can be used. An ability can be either, _passive_ ,
_minor_ , _heart_ , _major_ , _weekly_ , or _monthly_. This tag is
always listed as the first tag.

Pas s i v e A b i l i t y

There are no restrictions on how many times you
can use this ability. If the ability is a passive ability,
it is assumed to always be active.

Minor Ability

You may use this ability by spending a rush point
for each time you have used this ability including
this one during the current encounter. You may not
use it outside of an encounter.

Heart Abilit y

You may use this ability once per long rest. If
you take a wound, you may use the ability again.

Major Ability

```
You may use this ability once per long rest.
```

Weekly Abilit y

```
You may use this ability once per week.
```

Monthly Ability

```
You may use this ability once per month.
```

Ti m ing Tag

Outside of combat, you can use an ability
whenever you want—there are no restrictions
besides the ones listed on the ability itself. However,
during combat, you must have priority to use your
abilities. Priority is described in detail in the Combat
section. However, the _instant_ tag is an exception to

```
that rule. Abilities that don’t have the instant tag are
referred to as “priority abilities”.
```

```
Instant
If an ability is marked as instant, it means that
the ability can be used literally any time, even when
you don't have priority. While another creature is
using an ability, while you roll dice for an attack—
literally any time, so long as the ability doesn’t have
any further explicit instructions on when it can be
used.
If multiple creatures want to use an instant
ability, whoever declared their use last goes first.
You must declare the way in which you are using
your ability when you announce that you are using
an ability.
```

```
Act ion Tag
During each round of combat, you only have one
action. By default, abilities don’t use your action
unless they have the full action tag.
If an ability is marked as full action , it means that
the ability uses your action. If you don't have an
action left during this round, you cannot use the
ability.
```

Other Rules

```
Forced Movement
If you are ever pushed or forced to move, and
this movement is interrupted by a wall, another
creature that is within two sizes of your own, or a
heavy shield being wielded by an enemy, you
immediately stop moving and take 1d6 damage for
every 5 feet remaining in your movement. If this
movement is stopped by a creature that is not
wielding a shield, the movement is still stopped, and
```

### GAMEPLAY BASICS

the total damage is split evenly between the two
creatures, rounded up for the creature being forced to
move.

Size

Creatures can be of many different sizes. From
smallest to largest, they are: minuscule, tiny, small,
medium, large, and then L2, L3, L4, and so on.
Different sizes come with different bonuses and
penalties, especially in combat.
Up to a thousand minuscule creatures can fit into
a single space, ten tiny creatures can fit on one
space; five small creatures can fit on one space; one
medium or large creature on one space; and creatures
of sizes L2 and greater take up a number of spaces
equal to the square of their level. For example, an L
creature would take up four spaces (2x2 spaces), and
an L5 creature would take up twenty-five spaces
(5x5 spaces).

At tacking

Whenever an attacking creature uses the might
stance to push a defending creature of a different
size, the defending creature may move more or less
than the default of 10 feet. If the defending creature
is smaller than the attacker, the defending creature
moves an additional 5 feet for each level of size
difference. If the defending creature is larger than the
attacker, the defending creature moves 5 fewer feet
for each level of size difference. This could mean
that the defending creature is not pushed at all.

Movement and Spaces

One creature can occupy and move through the
space of another creature if it is at least two sizes
smaller. Those creatures count as difficult terrain.
While in the same space as a non-hostile creature,
you also have one level of cover.

```
Weapons
Creatures of size small or tiny cannot wield
heavy weapons. Creatures of size tiny cannot wield
heavy or light weapons.
```

```
Li g h t i n g
There are three different states of lighting that
can occur in an environment: brightly lit, dim, and
dark.
Daylight, the immediate area around a lantern,
and intense fire all produce bright light. There are no
penalties to vision or combat while in a brightly lit
area.
Dim light can be found in alleyways, twilight,
and in all the spaces between bright light and
darkness. Perception and observation skill checks are
made with disadvantage for creatures that require
light to see.
Darkness is anywhere there is no light. Unless
you have darkvision, you cannot see anything.
```

```
Darkvision
Some creatures have darkvision. A creature with
darkvision can see in dim light as though it were
bright light, and can see in darkness as though it
were dim light.
```

```
Hiding
If the environment provides suitable places to
hide and the GM deems it reasonable, you may
choose to hide. This requires more than a single
action, and cannot be performed during combat.
When you attempt to hide, make a stealth skill
check. On a success you are hidden, and count as
unseen for the purposes of attacking.
While hidden, you may use your action to make
an opportunity attack against a creature you are
hidden from. You may still be obscured after you
```

attack, but you do not count as hidden and you
cannot make opportunity attacks.
All hidden creatures that wish to make
opportunity attacks may use their action to attack
before combat begins.

Te r r ain

As you adventure, you will encounter numerous
environments that all pose their own unique
challenges.

Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain is any terrain that is inherently
hard to move through, such as water, mud, or heavy
foliage. While in difficult terrain, after accounting
for other movement penalties, your remaining
movement speed is halved.

Wat e r

Doing anything while in or under water comes
with severe limitations. While shallow water counts
only as difficult terrain, deeper water requires that
you move at your swim speed. Unless you explicitly
have a swim speed, your base swim speed is 15 feet.
If you can still stand, you have disadvantage on all
A/D rolls and skill checks requiring movement. If
you cannot stand, or if you are underwater, you have
D5 on all of those rolls instead. Ranged weapons
travel half their distance when fired underwater.

Vertical Surfaces

When climbing, you may be required to make a
might check to determine if you can climb at all. On
a success, you can climb at your climb speed, which
unless otherwise explicitly stated, is 5 feet.

```
Sources of Dam age
There are several other sources of damage
besides combat. Some of the more common ones are
listed below.
```

```
Combat
Combat is one of the most common ways to lose
health. Check out the Combat section to learn more.
```

```
Hazards & Traps
There will be times when you have to avoid
damage from the environment. For example, being
hit by a falling rock, struck with a dart trap, or
getting knocked over by the jibing boom of a ship. In
these cases, you should make a saving throw,
detailed in the Saving Throws section. On a failure,
you will take damage.
```

```
Falling
When falling from 5 feet or more, roll an agility
saving throw against the height fallen. If you roll less
than the distance fallen, you take the difference as
damage.
```

```
Suffocation and Strangulation
There are different effects on one’s body
depending if you are holding your breath, or getting
strangled or suffocated by something else.
When holding your breath, make a might check.
You can hold your breath a number of rounds equal
to your result. Subtract one from the total number of
rounds whenever you take an action or move while
holding your breath. After you run out of breath, you
take the suffocating condition.
If you are strangled, unable to breathe, or were
suddenly prevented from breathing, then you begin
suffocating immediately.
```

### GAMEPLAY BASICS

Poisons

While exploring Alaria, you may come across
various poisons. Different poisons have different
properties and means of application. Some may
paralyze you, but only if ingested, while other may
kill you if they enter directly into your bloodstream,
but are otherwise harmless if swallowed. Some are
long lasting, some are instant, some can be applied to
weapons and maintain potency for minutes to days,
while others can’t be applied to weapons at all.
While most poisons will have specific rulings
applied to them individually, some general poisoning
rules apply to most of them.
Due to the difficulty of properly applying poison,
poison cannot be applied to a weapon during combat.
Each application of the poison uses up one dose of
that poison, and dealing damage with a weapon with
poison applied to it uses up the poison. Most poisons
can be applied to weapons prior to combat. The
length that the poison remains potent on the weapon
will vary from poison to poison, after which the
poison must be scraped off and a new coat applied in
order to still garner the same effects. Damage from
poison happens after the weapon attack—it is not
rolled with the attack dice.

Experience

```
Over the course of many games, you will gain
more and more XP. With this XP, you can purchase
new, interesting features for your character.
```

```
Gaining Experience
It is up to the GM to deliver XP to players. They
can decide what they want to award XP for,
depending on the type of game they want to run.
Common triggers for rewarding XP are pursuing
goals, reaching milestones in a story arc, winning
combats, or just length of session. Whatever the
metric for determining XP, the GM should
communicate this to the players.
```

```
Spending Experience
Between sessions, or during sessions so long as
you are not in combat, you may spend XP to access
new features. Use the following chart to find the cost
of your desired new feature.
Experience Options
Ty p e XP Cost Effect
Le v e l i n g
New Aspect 1 Add a new aspect at rank 1.
Increase Aspect X+1, Where X is the aspect’s
current level
```

```
Increase the rank of an aspect by 1.
```

```
Change Aspect 0 Replace the text of your aspect with different text.
```

```
GM Note
Granting XP equal to players’ combat rank is
a decent rule of thumb to keep players upgrading
their character every few sessions. If you want
slightly more aggressive growth, increasing this
by one, or even two can be okay.
```

New Aspect

Creating a new aspect means writing down
another word or phrase describing your character.
The aspect starts at rank one.

Increase Aspect

Increase the rank of one your aspects by one.
Aspects cannot have a rank greater than five.

Change Aspect

You may replace your aspect with a brand new
aspect, if you believe your character development
warrants it. The aspect remains at the same rank, but
you may change the description.

Increase Maximum Hit Points

```
Increase your maximum hit points by 10.
```

Increase Ability Die

Increase an ability die by one size. Ability die
size increases in the order d4 > d6 > d8 > d10 > d12

> d20. Each increase costs XP equal to the size of the
> new die, so an increase from d8 to d10 would cost

10. You cannot increase your heart die in this way.

```
New Combat/Non-Combat Talent
Choose and mark down a new talent from the
combat or non-combat talent list. If it is a cognitive
or martial talent, you immediately gain it. Otherwise,
see the Talent section for details on the prerequisites

### GAMEPLAY BASICS

## Journeys

When the travel is safe and not a focus of
gameplay, such as on a well-traveled road between
nearby towns, you only need to know the basics of
travel speed so you can determine how long it takes
(described below). In these cases, you are assumed
to reach your destination in the appropriate amount
of time and the game can continue at the new
location.
However, in cases where travel is a major focal
point of gameplay, the rest of this section describes
the rules for travel.

Tr av e l B a s i cs

The first step in beginning a journey is figuring
out how long it will take. You can calculate this by
using your daily travel speed. The GM should then
segment the journey, and add events, which will be
explained later in this section.

Travel Speed

Your travel speed is calculated based off your
movement speed. The following sections describe
how far you can travel in different terrain. These
distances represent miles of progress towards your
destination, not absolute distance traveled.
When you begin, the GM should calculate how
long it will take reach your destination, assuming
everything goes well.

On Foot

If you are on a path on flat ground, you can cover
24 miles per day. In difficult terrain, such as swamps,

```
jungles, and mountains (as determined by the GM),
this distance is halved. If you are not on a path, this
movement speed is also halved.
```

```
On a Vehicle
If you are on horseback, in a carriage, or
traveling via some other land-vehicle, use the
vehicle’s daily travel speed rather than your own.
Horses and carriages have the same movement speed
as humans for the purposes of calculating daily
travel speeds, but they will have greater carrying
capacity and will not be penalized by your own
movement penalties, such as those from armor.
```

```
Segmenting the Journe y
On long trips through varied terrain, the GM
should segment the journey into different distinct
sections, broken at each major change in terrain. For
example, if the the trip is through the mountains and
into the forests beyond, there may be a segment of
mountain travel and a segment of forest travel. Most
trips do not need multiple segments.
When segmenting trips, the GM should calculate
how long each segment should take based off the
distance and travel speed in that segment of the
journey.
```

```
Events
Besides survival, these are what make a journey
into an adventure. Events can include things such as
falling avalanches, bandits attacking, tombs being
discovered, and just about anything else you can
imagine creating a situation where danger or further
investigation might be warranted.
```

The GM should add between one and five events
to most journeys, sticking with lower numbers on
shorter journeys or longer, safer ones, and higher
numbers for longer, more dangerous journeys. If
there are multiple segments in the trip, it’s usually a
good idea to add at least one event per segment.

Making the

Journey

When you actually leave for the journey, for each
segment, the GM should determine if any of the
following survival challenges are necessary to the
wellbeing of the players during the segment, and
couldn’t be reasonably prepared for or already
accounted for:

- Keep Watch
- Navigate - Collect Water - Gather Food - Find Shelter
  If you are bringing enough food and water for the
  duration of the segment, for example, the GM should
  not include _Gather Food_ or _Collect Water_. The tasks
  the GM deems as necessary will each require one or
  more successful skill checks in order to avoid
  turning into a bigger problem for you and your party.
  You or someone else from the party must make a
  skill check for each of these needs, using the
  challenge number from the table below. The same
  person can make multiple skill checks, but they get
  disadvantage on each skill checks they make for
  every additional skill check they have to make.
  Conversely, anyone not making a skill check can
  grant advantage to exactly one skill check being
  made by another player.

```

### JOURNEYS

```
GM Note
Some journeys don’t need any skill checks
for their travel phases. If the players are traveling
through farmland, just use the travel phase as a
brief montage opportunity before having an event
phase.
GM Note
Check out the Journey chapter in the GM
section of this book. There’s lots of advice on
how to come up with interesting events and
advice on when to use them.
```

To t a l S u c c e s s

On succeeding at every skill check, the journey
progresses to the event phase. No challenge phases
are triggered.

Skill Check Failure

If a skill check is failed, players can face
consequences. Each skill check has its own
consequences for failure. If multiple skill checks are
failed, the GM may choose to resolve them in
whichever order they wish.

Skill Check Consequences

Each travel phase skill check has it’s own
consequences for failure.

Keep Watch

Succeeding on this skill check represents keeping
a watchful eye on your surroundings throughout the
travel phase. When you successfully keep watch,
when an event occurs, you and the party see any
threats present before they see you.
On a failure, any people or creatures from an
event surprise you.

```
Navigate
Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently staying on track towards your
destination.
On a failure, the party fails to make progress
towards the destination and the party enters an event
phase. This event does not count towards the total
number of events for the journey.
```

```
Gather Food
Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently fishing, hunting, or foraging
successfully enough to keep everyone fed during the
travel phase.
On a failure to gather food, the travel phase ends
and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get food,
you cannot resume the travel phase. You may have to
eat pack animals, consume unidentified plants, hunt
more dangerous creatures, or simply go hungry until
food becomes available again.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that food is still an issue
for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll this skill
check for the travel phase.

```

Collect Water

Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently finding enough clean drinking water to
keep everyone hydrated during the travel phase.
On a failure to collect water, the travel phase
ends and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get
water, you cannot resume the travel phase. You may
have to drink unclean water, journey to more
dangerous water sources, or else simply go thirsty
and wait until water becomes available again.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that water is still an
issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll
this skill check for the travel phase.

Find Shelter

Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently finding safe places to build shelter and
get good rest away from the elements. If you have a
tent, you get +4 to this roll. If you have a bedroll,
you get +3 to this roll. If you are not at a comfortable
temperature, as per the rules in the Temperature
section, you get -3 to this roll per temperature tier
you are off by.
On a failure to find shelter, the travel phase ends.
It is nightfall and you cannot find a safe place to set
up camp. You may have to sleep in a more dangerous
location, or skip sleep altogether.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that shelter is still an
issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll
this skill check for the travel phase.

Other Interruptions

If you wish to stop the travel phase at any point,
you may do so. Regular game-time resumes until
you and your party agree to resume the journey. So
long as your general ability to travel survive and

```
travel safely has not changed, you should resume the
previous travel phase, keeping its rolls and results.
```

```
Healing During Travel
If you lose health during an encounter or during a
challenge phase, you
```

Challenge Phase

```
When a challenge phase begins, the montage of
travel is over. Challenge phases begin when you
have no food, no water, or no shelter. Gameplay
slows down to normal pace. You must now make
decisions as you would in a normal situation—the
GM describes the situation, and you have to figure
out what to do.
If you want to continue travel as you did before,
you must now make daily checks to keep watch,
gather food, collect water, navigate, and find shelter.
Everyone should make skill checks for these as they
would for the travel phase, unless they are doing
something uniquely different compared to what they
would have been doing during the travel phase. For
example, if you were riding a horse, ran out of food,
entered a challenge phase, and then butchered your
```

### TRAVEL & SURVIVAL

```
GM Note
Even though travel phases don’t all have to be
the same duration and it’s all a montage anyway,
it’s still important to have a good idea how long
each leg of the journey lasts. This way, if players
get stuck in a challenge phase at some point and
decide to tough it out till the end, you know how
many days it will take. It also means you can
calculate how many long rests they have between
events, so they can heal an appropriate amount.
```

horse for food, you would not need to make a skill
check to gather food for a few days.

Daily Consequences

Failing any of these skill checks results in the
same consequences as normal, though they occur
immediately, and do not trigger new challenge
phases—you just remain in the existing one.
While in the challenge phase, it is possible you
will spend time going hungry or thirsty, without
sleep, or too hot or cold. Each has their own
consequences as outlined in the Basic Needs section.

Ending the Challenge Phase

If you start a day after succeeding at every
required skill check the day before, you are capable
of traveling, and there are no obvious threats to your
immediate safety, the challenge phase ends and you
resume the travel phase. The GM may continue the
montage of travel.
Alternatively, if the GM rules that you’ve gone
enough distance to reach your destination, the
journey ends.

Event Phase

Events represent highlights and notable moments
from a journey (in addition to any struggles faced
during challenge phases). They can take a wide
variety of forms, some good, some bad, and they
should be introduced as an interruption to travel. For
example, the GM might describe rounding a hill after
days of travel and seeing the colossal ruins of a
destroyed dwarven fortress on the mountainside. The
players can now investigate the fortress in normal
game-time.
Once players are finished with an event, are no
longer threatened by it, and have chosen to move on,

```
the event phase ends and the next travel phase
begins.
```

```
Pac k A n i m al s
If you are traveling light, you may be able to
```

```
carry all of the necessary gear you need on your
back. However, on longer trips you will likely want a
pack animal, especially if you want to bring all your
food with you. See the Equipment & Gear section
for rules on carrying capacity and a list of common
equipment.
```

Journey Modes

```
When traveling long distances, there are two
modes of gameplay: travel mode, and action mode.
In travel mode, time passes quickly, and the GM
should describe the activities of the party like a
montage. You are welcome to chime in to describe
what you are doing as you travel, but this gameplay
occurs at macro pace. The GM may describe the
highlights of the journey, small oddities you may
have noticed along the trail, but nothing that out of
the ordinary.
The second mode of travel is action mode. In
action mode, play returns to micro pace—you're
back to deciding what you want to do, moment to
moment, scene by scene.
During a journey, most of the distance traveled
will likely occur in travel mode. However, when
```

```
GM Note
For advice on how to make and run
interesting events, see the Travel Events section.
```

survival becomes a challenge, or notable incidents
occur, the journey will switch to action mode and
you and your party will have to figure out how to
deal with it. Once you have dealt with whatever
came up, along with whatever other fallout came of
it, you may return to travel mode and continue along
your journey.

GM breaks trip into segments of terrain. Each
segment requires X successful travel checks to get
through uneventfully, and is Y days of travel long.
Gm should also make Z number of events to put in
throughout the journey.

```
Roll each check, as necessary.
```

As you get to different places along the journey,
if you had been in travel mode it triggers a re-roll.
All failures occur simultaneously.

When you fail roll, GM chooses which one
actually causes the journey to grind to a halt. The
rest of the failures just impose disadvantage on the
next check to that roll.

```
Each travel segment should have a chance of
```

Split trip into segments of terrain. Each terrain
segment has its own travel mode roll. GM should
sprinkle those failures in wherever they see fit while
players are in that section. Once action mode has
begun, the GM can spend those failures on failures
during action mode.

When in action mode, the check to hunt is much
more interactive. Roll to find animals, roll to kkill

```
them, the animals you find are random duration
worth of food. Other people can help for advantage.
Collecting water failure means you have to keep
traveling into the night to find some.
Shelter failure means you need to keep traveling,
or not sleep or find a more dangerous place to spend
the night.
Navigation failure means you make no progress
and have a chance to hit a new encounter. Can make
one in the day.
When action mode begins, have days of food
equal to surplus on food finding roll. Roll 1 higher,
and you have one extra day of food. All canteens are
full.
Can resume travel mode once more than half of
the party has finished a successful long rest.
```

```
1.Segment trip as necessary between different
terrains, if present. Many trips will have just one
terrain and tehrefore just one segment.
2.Approximate length of each segment in miles
and time
3.Add X events to the trip. They can come up
whenever, though at least one per terrain is good
idea.
4.May Y rolls for each necessity for each
segment, in order. If the segment requires 4 rolls,
then the first roll represents the first quarter of the
distance traveled.
5.Whenever a roll is failed, things go to shit
immediately. GM chooses which roll causes party
to fail. The remaining ones just act as
disadvantage on the rolls during action phase.
```

### TRAVEL & SURVIVAL

## Basic Needs

Although usually not necessary to track, basic
needs such as water, food, and warmth are all things
that can spell life or death when they are in short
supply, such as when in a challenge phase during a
journey.

Food

Whenever you start a new day having not eaten a
ration of food the day before, you gain a level of
weakened, off-balanced, or dazed, at random. For
every 24 hours thereafter, gain one level of each
condition. These conditions do not fade until you
consume two rations of food.
After a number of days have passed equal to 10
times your might die, you starve.

Wat e r

Whenever you start a new day having not drunk
a ration of water the day before, you gain two levels
of weakened, off-balanced, and dazed. These
conditions do not fade until you drink two rations of
water.
If this occurs for two consecutive days, you die
on the third morning.

Te m pe r at u r e

There are six tiers of temperature. The GM
should make sure to communicate the temperature if

```
it is ever anything other than comfortable and
staying warm or cool is a concern.
```

- Searing hot
- Muggy/Sweltering
- Comfortable
- Chilly
- Freezing
- Bone-chilling
  While adventuring in extreme heat or cold, you
  must track your own tier of warmth. If you get too
  cold or hot, you could suffer penalties or even die.
  Without clothes or fire, your temperature rating is
  equal to the ambient temperature.
  Depending on your temperature, there are
  different effects you suffer from.

```
Muggy/Sweltering & Chilly
These temperatures don't inflict penalties, but
they make it harder to sleep. Check out the Rests &
Healing section for details on sleeping checks.
```

```
Searing Hot
If you spend a quarter of the day at a searing hot
temperature, roll 1d12. On a 10 or higher, you take a
wound of rank equal to the result, labeling it
“heatstroke”. On a result less than 10, you take that
much damage but suffer no wounds.
```

```
Freezing
If you spend a quarter of the day freezing, roll
1d10 and take a wound of rank equal to the result,
labeling it “frostbite”. So long as you are freezing,
this wound does not heal.
```

Bone-Chilling

If you spend a quarter of the day where your
temperature is bone-chilling, roll 6d10 and take a
wound of rank equal to the result, labeling it
frostbite. So long as you are freezing, this wound
does not heal.

Modulating Temperature

Fortunately, by using shelter, fire, and clothes,
you can modulate your temperature to avoid the
associated penalties with the extremes.

Shelter

While you are in shelter, your temperature counts
as one tier closer to comfortable. Tents and caves
count as shelter. For other natural features it is up to
the GM to determine if the feature counts as shelter.

Fire

While next to a fire, your temperature counts as
one tier higher. You cannot build a fire in a tent
unless specifically stated otherwise.

Clothes

Different clothes can increase your temperature
by one or more tiers. Checkout the Equipment &
Gear section for the different clothes. You cannot
sleep in your clothes, but an insulated bedroll will
also work.

## Equipment & Gear

Encumbrance

Your capacity for carrying stuff is tracked using
encumbrance points (EP), each representing about
five pounds of weight. Your maximum EP is equal to
6 plus half of your might die. For example, if you
have a d4, your maximum EP is 8. This doesn’t mean
you can’t carry more than 40 (8 \* 5) pounds, it just
means that you can’t carry more than that for hours
at a time without becoming exhausted and having to
make endurance checks on a case by case basis, as
determined by the GM.
Different adventuring gear has different EP
values. You can see the EP values and prices of all
gear in the table below. Regardless of if you're
wearing the gear or carrying it, if it's on you, the EP
counts against your maximum EP.

Pac k A n i m al s & Vehicles

By using a pack animal or vehicle, you can cary
substantially more gear.

Some of the gear in the table have limited uses, denoted by the “dX uses”. If something has dX uses, then you should roll an X-sided die. If the result is a 1,

```

## Combat

Combat occurs in rounds, broken up by abilities
and engagements. Engagements are short scenes of
combat between participants, and are used to abstract
the actions of multiple combatants all trying to attack
each other.
During each round, everyone will have the
chance to use whatever abilities they can and take
actions, though the order of all these things can vary
from round to round. There are not “turns” in the
traditional sense.

Starting Combat

When combat begins, everyone loses priority.
That means they cannot use abilities that are not
_instant_. Instead, priority will be granted to a starting
side, and then pass back and forth until everyone in
the round has done all of the things they want to do.
The first step is determining who starts with
priority. If one side wasn’t expecting to get attacked,
the other side gains priority and should choose
someone on their side to start. If both sides saw
combat coming, the players should roll 1d6 to
determine which side gets starting priority, with a 4
or higher resulting in the players getting priority
first. The starting side will begin each subsequent
round with priority.

Priority During Combat

When your side in a fight has priority, anyone on
your side can use an ability. Once they do, priority
passes to the other side. If they don’t want to use an
ability (or can't), priority passes back to your side.

```
This continues until neither side wishes to do
anything, in which case the round ends. Note that
abilities with the instant tag do not require priority,
and do not trigger priority passing to the other side.
In overview, the sequence will look like this:
someone on the side with priority will use an ability.
Once that ability resolves, anyone on the other side
can choose to use an ability next. If nobody on that
side wants to, then anybody on the original side gets
another turn. If none of them want to do anything, it
passes to the other side one final time. If all of them
still don’t want to use an ability, then the round is
over.
If, however, someone does want to use an ability,
then the sequence starts over. In effect, so long as
both sides are frantically trying to use their abilities,
both sides will alternate using abilities. However, if
one side is no longer interested in or able to use any
abilities, the other side will be able to
uninterruptedly continue using abilities until the
other side decides to jump back in.
During engagements, which are explained in the
Engaging the Enemy section, nobody gets priority.
As soon as someone enters an engagement, neither
side has priority until the engagement ends.
```

### COMBAT

```
Engagements Are Important
Engagements are the core of Heart Rush
combat, and they might take a bit of time to
wrap your head around. There’s a whole
section (Engaging the Enemy) on it, but the
idea is that you’re entering a chaotic melee
where anyone could get hurt, including
yourself.
```

During Combat

During each round of combat, you can take up to
one action, and use any number of abilities
(following the frequency restrictions on the abilities
themselves).

Act ions

You get one action per round. All actions are
abilities, and as with all abilities, you must have
priority to use them.
Note that the _Dash_ action, _Object Interaction_
action, and _Call Out_ action do not cost an action the
first time you perform them each round.

Engage the Enemy
_Full action._
As an action, you may engage with the enemy.
This does not guarantee that you’ll injure them, or
even hit them in the first place. In fact, they might hit
you instead.
Rules for engagement are complicated, and are
described in detail in the Engaging the Enemy
section below. As a simple analogy, using your
action to engage the enemy can be described as
initiating a rock-paper-scissors game of combat with
the enemy, with the victor having the chance to
injure the loser.

Cast A Spell
_Full action._

See the Spellcasting section for details and
restrictions on casting spells. You cannot cast a spell
if you do not know any spells.

Sidestep
_Full action\*._
Rather than using an action, you may instead
spend a rush point to perform this ability.

```
When you take this action, you may move 5 feet
or stand up from prone. This movement does not
provoke opportunity attacks.
```

```
Dash
Full action*.
The first dash you take each round does not cost
your action.
Move a number of feet up to or equal to your
move speed. Unless stated otherwise, your move
speed is 60 before accounting for equipment.
If you move more than 5 feet within a creature’s
melee range or leave their melee range without
taking the sidestep action, the creature may make an
opportunity attack against you. Resolve the attack
before leaving the creature’s range and completing
the movement.
```

```
Object Interaction
Full action*.
The first object interaction you take each round
does not cost your action.
Any sort of simple interaction with an object
counts as an interaction action. Stowing a weapon
and retrieving a new one are two separate object
interactions.
```

```
Help
Full action.
You aid another creature. Choose an adjacent
creature. That creature gets advantage on its next A/
D roll, skill check, or saving throw.
```

```
Call Out
Full action*.
The first call out you make each round does not
cost your action.
Say (or shout out) something. Up to one,
reasonable-length sentence.
```

Instant Actions

Below are some actions that you can take at
instant speed, even while another creature is doing
an action. They do not trigger priority changes.

Enter An Engagement

_Full action. Instant._
As an action, you may enter an engagement that
has already been initiated between other characters
but has not yet begun. Unlike other abilities, you do
not need priority to use this ability. Instead,
immediately after someone uses the _Engage the
Enemy_ action, everyone has the choice to take this
action until nobody else wishes to do so.
There must be a valid target in range of your
weapon who is already part of the engagement in
order to enter. To continue the analogy from the
explanation of engaging the enemy, this is like
deciding to jump into a rock-paper-scissors game
going on between the people around you, and
choosing to play as well.

Tr i p

_Full action. Instant._
Whenever a creatures with a level of off-
balanced moves (willingly or forced) through a space
that is adjacent to you, if that creature is no more
than one size larger than you, you may trip the
creature, immediately knocking it prone in that
space.

Opportunity Attack

_Full action\*. Instant._
Rather than using an action, you may instead
spend a rush point to perform this ability.
Opportunity attacks represent moments when an
enemy has presented an easily exploited weakness.
They let you make an attack against them without
first winning an engagement.

```
You can only take this action if one or more of
the following conditions is met:
```

- The enemy willingly leaves your melee reach
  without using the sidestep ability.
- The enemy willingly moves more than 5 feet
  within your melee reach without using the sidestep
  ability.
- The enemy stands up without using the
  sidestep action.
- You are hidden.
- The target of your action is surprised.
  When you take this action, make an attack roll
  against the creature with the stance of your choice.

```
Rush Poin ts
Rush represents the excitement and tension of a
fight. As a fight goes on, rush points build, and you
can perform more and more powerful moves. Rush is
represented with a pool of points. At the start of
combat, you have one rush point. At the beginning of
each subsequent round, you gain rush points equal to
the number of rounds in which you were part of an
engagement, made an opportunity attack, or cast a
spell, up to the current number of rounds. Other
abilities may increase this pool further.
Unspent rush points are lost at the end of every
round.
Outside of combat, you have 0 rush points.
```

```
Hard To Get, but Great
Opportunity attacks are like gold. They’re
hard to get, but when you do, you can throw
everything you’ve got into the roll and nail the
target exactly the way you want. For this
reason, enemies will do a lot to avoid getting
hit with them. Use that to your advantage.
```

### COMBAT

Minor Abilities

Minor abilities are special abilities unique to
your class and subclass. Whenever you use a minor
ability, you must spend one rush point for each time
you’ve used the ability, including the current use.
You have multiple minor abilities, so you will have
to manage how many times you’ve used each
separately. They do not require you to spend an
action, but there may be limitations on when you can
use them.

Major Abilities

Major abilities are like ultimate moves your
character has. Unlike minor abilities, major abilities
can only be used once per day. Major abilities gained
from your class have additional, optional rush point
costs, meaning that your major abilities will get
stronger and stronger the longer the fight lasts. They
do not require you to spend an action, but there may
be limitations on when you can use them

Special Use Cases

Rush points can also be spent to make
opportunity attacks or to sidestep.

Engaging the

Enemy

An engagement with the enemy may be a short
flurry of crossing blows, or it may be part of a larger
melee with dozens of combatants.
In either case, when you first decide to engage
the enemy—taking the _Engage the Enemy_ action—
choose an enemy you could theoretically hit with the
weapon you are currently wielding. You and this
enemy are now part of the engagement. The enemy
does not have a choice in entering this engagement,

```
and participating in this engagement does not cost
them their action.
As an engagement has now begun, creatures no
longer get priority. The engagement must be resolved
before creatures get priority again. However, first,
other creatures get a chance to join.
Other creatures within weapon range of anyone
in the engagement may decide to enter the
engagement as well. If they wish to do so, they can
spend their action to join the engagement. This is the
Enter an Engagement action.
```

```
Choosing Stances
Once everyone who wants to and is allowed to
join the engagement has done so, every combatant
within the engagement must secretly choose their
stance: might, agility, cunning, or the defensive
stance. Once everyone has chosen, everyone must
reveal their choice. Attacks proceed in a manner
similar to rock paper scissors, as outlined in the
sections below.
Note that if the players wish to discuss which
stance to choose among themselves, the GM should
choose the stance for the enemies before the players
decide for their characters, to prevent any
accusations of cheating by reacting to the decisions
made by the players.
```

```
Ty p i c a l R o u n ds
In most rounds, you’ll want to move a bit—
the first dash is free—and you’ll want to start
or enter an engagement, since that’s the main
way to deal damage. Sprinkled throughout,
you’ll use various abilities and occasionally
you’ll want to do something else with your
action, but moving and engaging is the gist.
```

Cunning

Those who chose cunning are able to easily read
and avoid the attacks of anyone who can’t beat them
with raw strength, and get to make an attack against
a single creature in the engagement that didn’t take
the might stance. Creatures that chose the cunning
stance make their attack rolls first, in any order.
Cunning directly beats agility. Whenever you use
this stance to attack a creature defending with the
agility stance, you may apply up to two levels of
dazed, off-balanced, or weakened to that creature.

Agilit y

Those who chose agility are able to maneuver
their way past those who can’t read their actions, and
get to make an attack against a single creature in the
engagement that didn’t take the cunning stance.
Creatures that chose the agility stance can make their
attack rolls after all of the cunning stance attack rolls
have been made.
Also, if you choose this stance, you may take the
sidestep action for free during the engagement, right
before or after you make your attack. Creatures that
choose to attack before moving get to attack before
creatures that sidestep and then attack. If creatures
on opposite sides of a fight get to move via the
agility stance, both sides should alternate who
moves, starting with whichever side was originally
engaged with.

Might

Those who chose might are able to crush those
who are not agile enough to get out of the way, and
get to make an attack against a single creature in the
engagement that didn’t take the agility stance.
Creatures that chose the might stance make their
attack rolls last.
Additionally, whenever you attack a creature
defending with the cunning stance, you trigger your

```
weapon’s might stance bonus. Check out the
Weapons section to learn more.
```

```
Defensive
Anyone who chose the defensive stance does not
get to attack, but will not take as much damage.
After subtracting your defense from an attack, halve
the remaining damage, rounding up.
```

```
Resolution
After everyone has revealed their stance, it is
time for attacks. Everyone may attack one other
character that their stance beats, and is within range
of their weapon. All stances beat defensive stance. If
no one else took a stance that they could beat, or
they aren’t in range of your weapon, you cannot
attack in this engagement.
Attacks should happen in order of
1.Cunning
2.Agility
3.Might.
Starting with cunning, anyone who chose the
cunning stance may choose to attack each other or
anyone who chose the agility or defensive stance.
Proceed in order.
Although attacks of the same stance may not
literally happen simultaneously, treat them as though
they did. For example, if you push a creature away
with a melee weapon using the might stance, it
cannot prevent them from attacking a creature that
they were previously in range of hitting with the
might stance. Likewise, if the attack would kill them,
they still get to hit another creature first.
Note that if an attack pushes a target before the
target's stance goes, such as if a cunning attacker
pushed someone who had chosen agility, the target
might not be in range of anyone any more, and
would be unable to attack or be attacked during the
subsequent turns for the remaining stances.
```

### COMBAT

At tacking

If you get to attack someone, you make an attack
roll consisting of your heart die + ability die for the
stance you chose + weapon die. Then, the defending
creature makes a defense roll using their heart die +
ability die corresponding to the stance you chose +
armor bonuses.
After both sides roll, the defender then takes
damage equal to the the result of the attack roll
minus the defense roll. If this would be negative, the

```
defender instead takes no damage. See the next
section to determine how damage is dealt with.
Note that if you are attacking someone who is
attacking you back with the same stance, make
contested attack rolls rather than two separate attack
and defense rolls.
Anyone can attack someone who takes the
defense stance. Make contested rolls as normal, but
the resulting damage is halved.
```

```
Example
You initiate a fight, and dash towards the undead orc in front of you. Priority passes to the enemies. The
orc’s undead wolf dashes, coming adjacent to you as well. Priority passes back to you and allies. Your ally
decides she wants to shoot the first orc with an arrow, announcing she’s entering an engagement. Since an
engagement has started, nobody can use abilities that aren’t instant now.
You decide to join the engagement, since you can attack the orc too. The undead hound joins the
engagement as well. The orc is already in the engagement, so it doesn’t have to use its action to join.
The engagement begins. You coordinate with your archer ally—you’ll choose might, she’ll choose
agility. You announce you’re ready, and stances are revealed. The orc chose might, and the hound chose
cunning. Time to resolve attacks.
1.Cunning happens first. Although cunning beats agility, the hound is not adjacent to your archer friend,
so the hound does nothing.
2.Agility comes next. Your ally chose agility, which beats the might stance of the orc. Your ally, seeing
she’s got the upper hand, decides to user her Execute ability, meaning her attack will deal a lot more
damage. She makes an attack roll against the orc, and the orc makes a defense roll. The orc decides it’s
more damage than he’s interested in, and decides to reduce his heart die to halve the damage. He remains
alive.
3.After agility comes might. You and the orc both chose might. Since you chose might, you can attack
either the orc (since you tied stances), or the hound (might beats cunning). You decide to attack the orc
since the orc is a greater threat and you want him dead. However, the orc decided to attack you as well,
since you were its only target. You each make contested attack rolls, with the loser taking the difference in
damage. Unfortunately you roll a bit lower, so you end up taking a few points of damage.
The engagement ends, since everyone who can attack has done so. The enemies now have priority. At
this point, nobody except for the orc has an action left, since the orc didn’t have to use an action to join the
engagement (they were forced to join). The orc might enter an engagement again with you, in which case
nobody else would have actions left to join, or they might not. The round continues.
```

Priority After the Engagement

Priority passes to side that was targeted when the
engagement first started, and continues as usual.

Ta k i n g D a m ag e

When you take damage, you can choose to use
some of your stamina to “shrug off” or "dodge" the
injury. In this case, you take half as much damage,
but your heart die falls one size. If you cannot
decrease your heart die because it's already a d4, you
must take the full amount of damage.
Regardless, whatever damage you do take gets
subtracted from your hit points. If this would cause
your hit points to reach a negative amount equal to
your maximum hit points, you are dead.

More Than 10 Damage

If you take 10 or more damage, this represents
serious bodily harm. In addition to reducing your hit
points, mark a wound. The GM will give you a plain
English description of the wound. For example, a
wound could be “a nasty gash in your arm,” or “a
fractured leg,” or “your guts are spilling out”. Write
this down. Next to it, write the rank of the wound.
The rank is equal to the amount of damage you took.
Read more about wounds in the next section.

Wou n ds

Wounds reduce your maximum hit points.
Whenever you gain hit points, you cannot increase
your hit points beyond your normal maximum minus
the sum of the ranks of all your wounds. So if you
normally have a 40 hit point maximum, but you have
23 ranks worth of wounds, you can't heal past 17 hit
points.
Outside of combat, wounds are like aspects,
which you can read about in the Aspects section

```
(page 10). Since they have a description and a rank,
you or the GM can invoke them for a penalty on a
roll equal to the rank of the wound, in exchange for
DP equal to the rank of the wound, up to 5.
```

```
Tr e a t i n g W ou n ds
Whenever you take a wound, you'll want to get it
treated. Treating a wound will mitigate a large
amount of the harm. To treat a wound, make a
medicine skill check and reduce the rank of all
untreated wounds affecting the wounded creature by
the rolled amount. If this would reduce a wound's
rank below zero, remove the wound completely.
If you are treating your own wounds, you have
disadvantage.
You can treat any number of wounds at once, but
once a wound has been treated it cannot be treated
again. Once treated, these wounds will naturally heal
over time when you take long rests. See the Rests &
Healing section for more details.
```

```
Zero Hit Points
When your hit points reach zero, you are in bad
condition. If you wish, you may choose to go
```

### COMBAT

```
Example
You are at 25 hit points, and have a d6 heart
die. You lose an engagement and they are going
to deal 30 damage. This won’t kill you, but it’ll
put you below 0, meaning you’d go unconscious
after 10 minutes. You don’t want this, so you
instead choose to decrement your heart die, going
down to a d4. Instead of 30 damage, you take 15,
going down to 10 hit points. Then, because you
took over 10 damage, you take a wound. The GM
tells you that that your leg is badly smashed. You
write down “Smashed leg: 15”. That’s going to
suck.
```

unconscious. If you do not, you fall unconscious
anyway after 10 minutes. If you take damage while
at or below zero, continue to mark that damage and
any wounds—you can go into the negative.
If your hit points ever reach an amount equal to
or less than the negative of your maximum, you die.
Once you are unconscious, you remain
unconscious so long as your hit points are zero or
fewer.
You can recover hit points and reduce wounds by
taking rests. Read more in the Rests & Healing
section.

Other Offensive

Act ions

If you want to do something to an enemy other
than hit it with a weapon, such as grapple it, climb
onto it, or otherwise mess with it, it still begins with
winning an engagement. However, you must win the
engagement by directly beating their stance—both
choosing the same stance does not let you perform
these types of acts. Assuming you have directly
beaten their stance, you may forgo your attack roll
and instead use one of these other options. If you do,

```
the effects of the offensive action occur after all
attack rolls have been made.
Some of these options requires a contested skill
check, rather than an attack and defense roll. These
contested checks still receive advantage or
disadvantage as though they were an attack or
defense roll of their corresponding ability, but they
should not use any additional dice (such as from
your weapon) or bonuses from armor.
```

```
Grappling
Make a might ability check against an adjacent
creature, contested by the creature’s own might or
agility ability check. If either creature is larger, it
gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level
of size difference.
If you roll higher, the creature is grappled. You
gain the condition grappling and the opposing
creature gains the condition grappled.
Unless otherwise specified, at least one hand
must be free to grapple another creature. You can
grapple with one or two hands. If grappling with
```

```
Example
You want to grapple an adjacent wolf before
it moves past you and attacks your badly hurt
friend. You enter an engagement with it, choose
stances, and stances are revealed. You chose
cunning, and it chose agility. Since cunning beats
agility, you get to attack. However, since you’re
trying to grapple it, you decide not to attack, and
instead make a might check. Your ally used the
help action earlier in the round, so you have
advantage. The wolf makes an agility check to
avoid getting grappled, but it rolls less than you.
The wolf is now grappled, and you are now
grappling. The wolf is stuck.
```

```
Why Would I Go Unconscious??
If you’re in a nasty fight, combatants tend
to try to attack the people who are still fighting
back. If you go unconscious, people usually
won’t view you as a threat, so you’re a lot less
likely to be attacked (and potentially die).
Things trying to eat you generally don’t abide
by this, so in some cases this is definitely not
recommended...
```

only one hand, halve your grapple ability check,
rounding up.
A creature can only be grappled by one creature
at a time, and can only grapple one creature at a
time.
While grappling a creature, rather than pushing
the creature when you use the might stance, you may
choose to instead deal 1d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage
for every size greater you are than the grappled
creature.

Climb On

Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes
larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check
contested by the creature’s might or agility ability
check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the
creature. So long as you are on the creature, you
have the _creature climber_ condition. Likewise, the
climbed on creature has the _climbed on_ condition.
A creature can only climb on one creature at a
time.

Hinder

When you choose this option, you perform some
other sort of option that interferes with your target.
This could be represented by throwing sand in their
eyes, kicking out their legs, or sucker punching
them. You must be adjacent to the creature you target
with this ability.
Choose one option from the following list:

- The creature takes 1d4 damage and 2 levels of
  weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
- The creature takes 1 level of blinded.
- The creature is knocked prone so long as it is
  no more than one size larger than you.
- Push the creature 5 feet. It travels 5 feet less for
  every size larger than you it is, and 5 feet more for
  every size smaller. The creature gains 2 levels of
  off-balanced.

```
Stunt
Choose your own effect, with the GM’s
permission. This could be something like stealing an
item from around the creature's neck, grabbing their
sword by the blade to turn it into clay, trying to taunt
the creature by patting them on the head, or swinging
into the creature from a rope to knock it off its feet.
In these cases, make a contested ability check
against the creature.
```

Special

Circumstances

```
Surprise
In some cases when combat begins, one or more
parties will be completely surprised, giving anyone
who was already prepared to fight a large advantage.
Special rules apply in these circumstances.
A creature is not surprised if they can see their
opponent before the round begins, and they are
unfriendly or hostile towards their opponent or don’t
know their opponent.
If one of the parties in an encounter is completely
surprised by combat, then each un-surprised creature
can use their action to make an opportunity attack,
and each surprised creature does not get to use
abilities or move on the first round of combat.
```

```
At tacking t he He lple ss
Sometimes, you will make attacks against
creatures that are completely unable to defend
themselves. At the GM’s discretion, you may make
an opportunity attack against the creature.
```

### COMBAT

Depending on the circumstances, the GM may also
choose for the creature to immediately die instead.

Cover

Cover is an important part of staying alive—if
you remain behind cover, you remain safe from
ranged enemy attacks. There are three different types
of cover, based on how many lines of sight exist
between the attacker and the defender. Determining
what type of cover you have from an attacker can be
done by drawing imaginary lines between any one
point on the attacker and each corner of a square that
the enemy takes the space of. For each line that is
obstructed by an obstacle, the attacker gets a level of
disadvantage on their ranged attack roll. If all four
lines are blocked by solid objects, you cannot attack
that creature.
Sometimes, obstacles do not lend themselves to
the line blocked method of determining cover. It is
then up to the GM to decide how much cover should
be awarded to the defender. Usually, anything small
but not very helpful like a small tree in the way of
your shot will provide one level of cover. Things that
the defender has to poke their body out from behind
to attack, such as the rise of a hill, or back of a
couch, provide two levels of cover. Lastly, things
that are specifically designed for uni-directional
attacks, such as arrow slits, will provide three levels
of cover.

## Rests & Healing

There are a few ways to regain hit points. The
primary method is by taking rests, but magic, racial
abilities, potions, and more can all cause healing in
other ways.

Rests

You can heal hit points, refresh heart dice, and
reduce wounds all with rests. There are two types of
rests: short rests and long rests.

Short Rest

A short rest is nothing more than 10 minutes of
stationary relaxation. When you take a short rest,
your heart die returns to its maximum. You can take
any number of short rests per day.

Lo n g R e s t

When you go to sleep for the night, that is a long
rest. Long rests must be at least 7 hours, and you can
only take one each day. When taking a long rest
away from shelter, bed, and warmth, you must also
make a sleeping check. Succeeding at a sleeping
check results in a “successful” long rest. On failing
the check, you have an unsuccessful long rest.
To make the sleeping check, roll 1d100 and add
all the relevant modifiers from the Sleeping
Conditions table below. On a 100 or higher, you
succeed.
While you do have warmth, a bed, and full
shelter, you do not need to make this check and are
assumed to succeed. If you do not rest for the night,

```
take the penalties associated with failing a sleeping
check.
```

```
Successful Sleeping Check
On a success, reduce the ranks of each of your
wounds by one, and heal hit points up to your current
maximum (it will be reduced if you have wounds).
```

### RESTS & HEALING

```
Example
You just survived a nasty fight. You have 14
hit points, a d4 heart die, and a rank 12 wound.
At first, you take a short rest—you have more
distance to cover before the day is done. Your
heart die becomes a d8 once more. Then, night
comes, and you take a long rest. It’s warm, but
you have no shelter. You fail your sleeping check.
Since your maximum hit points was 28 (40 - 12),
and you are currently at 14, you regain 7 hit
points, going up to 21. Additionally, you start the
next day with a level of dazed.
The next day you reach your destination,
getting a bed, warmth, and shelter, thereby
automatically succeeding your sleeping check.
Your wound decreases to rank 11, you heal to 29
hp (40 - 11), and you remove your level of dazed.
You realize you can spend some time in the
town without feeling pressured to leave, so you
stay safe and don’t leave, reducing your wound
by one each night till fully healed after 11 more
days.
```

Failed Sleeping Check

On a failure, do not reduce the ranks of your
wounds, and regain half of your missing hit points,
rounded down. Additionally, take a level of
weakened, off-balanced, or dazed, chosen at random.
A second night of failed sleep inflicts two conditions
at random, and a third night, along with every night
thereafter, inflicts one level of each condition. A
successful long rest removes all conditions gained
this way.

Healing

```
Besides rests, other effects and abilities may
cause you to heal hit points. When you heal hit
```

```
points, you cannot increase your hit points greater
than any restricted maximum due to wounds you
might have.

Healing Potions
Not every world setting will play with
healing potions, but if your game does, these
rules work well. One hour after drinking a
healing potion, reduce the rank of each of your
wounds by one and regain 20 hit points.
```

```
GM Note
The pacing of Heart Rush tends to be a bit
slower than other games; letting players take long
rests does not let them heal all that much, so
don’t feel pressured to pack multiple combats
into only a single day. A long trip through the
wilderness where good rest is uncertain and
combat is intermittent is plenty grueling for most
parties.
```

## Conditions

A variety of conditions can affect players and
enemies alike. They generally give advantage or
disadvantage to different sorts of rolls.

Tag s

There are three different types of tags each
condition can have: _leveled_ , _fading_ , and _ongoing_.

Le v e l e d

Some of the conditions are _leveled_ , meaning that
multiple instances of that condition can be applied.
These levels also stack, so if the same condition is
applied, both levels are added together. For example,
if a moon-viper bites you, it could apply two levels
of poison, giving you D2 to all rolls. If it then bit you
again, you would then increase the number of levels
of poisoned affecting you to four.
Conditions cannot be stacked greater than five
times. Once a creature has gained five levels of a
condition, further levels of that condition are
ignored.

Fading

Some conditions have _fading_ , which means that
the condition will quickly alleviate. When you take
levels of a condition that has fading, remove one
level of that condition at the start of each round.

Ongoing

An ongoing condition continues until otherwise
noted. It may be moments, it may be hours, it may be
days, and it might even be forever.

```
Physical Conditions
These conditions are likely to arise from basic
combat.
```

```
Dazed
Leveled. Fading.
You have disadvantage on all cunning checks.
```

```
Weakened
Leveled. Fading.
You have a disadvantage on all might checks.
```

```
Off-Balanced
Leveled. Fading.
You have a disadvantage on all agility checks.
```

```
Shaken
Leveled. Fading.
You have a disadvantage on all presence checks.
```

```
Restrained
Leveled. Ongoing.
Your move speed becomes zero and you cannot
dash or sidestep. You have disadvantage on all A/D
rolls and any ability checks requiring motion.
```

```
Stunned
Ongoing.
Your move speed becomes zero, and you cannot
take actions, use abilities, speak, or make attack
rolls.
```

### CONDITIONS

Incapacitated
_Ongoing._
Your move speed becomes zero, and you cannot
take actions, use abilities, or make attack rolls. In
addition, enemies may choose to use their action to
make opportunity attacks against you rather than
enter engagements.

Poisoned
_Leveled. Ongoing._
You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls.

Blinded

_Leveled. Fading._
You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls
requiring sight. If you have five levels of blinded,
you cannot see anything.

Suffocating
_Ongoing._
You take 1d6 damage at the end of each round
and whenever you move or take an action.

Slowed

_Leveled. Fading._
Your movement speed is halved, after accounting
for armor and other penalties. Additional levels only
result in a longer lasting effect.

Crippled

_Ongoing._
Your move speed becomes 5 feet.

Vulnerability
_Leveled. Ongoing._
Complications and failures can occur on 1s _as
well as_ 2s when making skill checks in whichever
state of vulnerability you are in. Physical
vulnerability means might and agility checks, and
mental vulnerability means cunning and presence

```
checks. An additional level of vulnerability triggers
complications or failures on 3s as well, and another
level results on complications or failures on 4s. If
you have four or more levels of vulnerability, you
die.
```

```
Mental Conditions
These condition are likely to arise from magical
effects.
```

```
Confused
Leveled. Ongoing.
You are addled. If you use your movement
during a round, you cannot take an action. If you
take an action, you cannot move. You have
disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls. Additionally,
you cannot cast spells.
All levels of confused can be removed if another
creature that can communicate with you takes the
help action to help you calm and align your thoughts.
```

```
Frightened
Leveled. Ongoing.
You are terrified of something. You have
disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls so long as you
are within line of sight of the source of your fear, and
you cannot willingly approach the source of your
fear. As an action, you may make a cunning saving
throw contested by the source’s presence challenge
number to immediately remove all levels of
frightened.
```

```
GM Note
These mental conditions are pretty powerful,
and generally shouldn’t be thrown around unless
it’s supposed to be a very powerful effect, or if
the effect is from a magical source.
```

Enraged
_Leveled. Ongoing._
You are overcome with rage at another creature.
You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls
against any other creature besides the source of your
rage. You may remove all levels of enraged if you
make an attack roll against the source of your
aggravation, or if another creature causes you to gain
a level of enraged. Additionally, as an action, you
may make a cunning saving throw contested by the
source’s presence challenge number to immediately
remove all levels of enraged.

Charmed
_Leveled. Ongoing._
For each level of charm, a you move up one level
on the enemy to friend track. If you are violent, you
become hostile. If you are hostile, you become
neutral. If you are neutral, you become friendly. If
you are friendly, you become allied.
The source of the charm has advantage on all
presence checks made against you. If the charmer
takes any hostile action against you, the charm effect
ends immediately.

Status Conditions

While many of these conditions can be caused by
combat, some of them have more to do with your
environment than any interaction with others.

Prone

_Ongoing._
You move at your climb speed (5 feet unless
stated differently). You have advantage on defense
rolls against ranged attacks, and have disadvantage
on all other A/D rolls. You can stand up by spending
half of your movement (after accounting for bonuses
and penalties to your movement), or by taking the
sidestep action.

```
Burning
Leveled. Fading.
When you take levels of burning, immediately
take Xd6 burning damage, where X is the number of
levels of burning you received.
While you have levels of burning, at the end of
each round, take 1d6 damage for each level of
burning affecting you.
As an action, you or another creature can attempt
to put out the fire, and remove half of the levels
affecting you, rounded up. If you would be drenched
or submerged in a nonflammable liquid, immediately
remove all levels of burning.
```

```
Obscured
Ongoing.
If you are not visible to a creature, but have not
hidden, then you are obscured. While obscured,
attacks against you have D5. Likewise, defense rolls
against obscured creatures have D5.
```

```
Hidden
Ongoing.
While hidden, you may make opportunity attacks
against creatures who cannot see you. Once you
make an attack, your position is revealed and you are
no longer hidden. Note that while hidden, you are
also obscured.
```

```
Highground
Ongoing.
If you are above another creature, such as
fighting from up a hill, or from the sky, you have the
high ground. You have advantage on your attack
rolls against creatures that don’t have the high
ground.
```

### CONDITIONS

Creature Climber
_Ongoing._
You have A3 on attack rolls against the creature
you are climbing on.
You may move on the creature using your climb
speed. The creature counts as difficult terrain.
If you would push the creature you are climbing
on any distance, instead inflict 1d6 damage.
If you take damage or are forced to move, you
must roll a might or agility saving throw against the
damage taken or distance pushed, whichever is
greater, falling off of the creature on a failure.
You may use 5 feet of movement to hop off the
creature when you can move.
Whenever the creature being climbed on moves,
you move with it.

Climbed-on

_Ongoing._
You have D3 on attacks against creatures
climbing on you.
As an action, you may try to shake off the
creatures that are climbing on you. Make a might or
agility check contested by the might or agility check
of every creature climbing on you. On a success,
they are thrown off.

Grappling

_Ongoing._
Your move speed becomes zero and you cannot
take the dash action. You have disadvantage on all A/
D rolls and any ability checks requiring motion.
When you sidestep, the grappled creature moves to
the space you were in previously.
If you are prone, you cannot stand up while
grappling.
Whenever the creature you are grappling is
forced to move, you may choose to be forced to
move that distance with it or release the grapple,
ending the grappled condition for it.

```
If you are forced to move, the grappled creature
moves with you.
Any damage that you or the grappled creature
takes due to forced movement is also applied to the
other.
```

```
Grappled
Ongoing.
You have 1 level of restrained.
As an action, you may try to break free. Make a
might or agility check contested by the might or
agility check of the creature grappling you. If either
creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their
roll for each level of size difference. On a success,
you are no longer grappled.
Levels of restrained inflicted from being
grappled do not inflict disadvantage on this roll.
Any damage that you or a creature grappling you
takes due to forced movement is also applied to the
other.
```

## Classes

Your class is the general role in combat that you
fill. It doesn’t say anything about what you do
outside of combat, and in games where combat is
more infrequent, your class will be less relevant to
gameplay compared to your aspects and talents.
There are three different classes—stronghearts,
battlehearts, and cleverhearts. Each has a distinct
combat style that makes them unique. Stronghearts
are beefier, and are responsible for preventing
enemies from killing their allies. Battlehearts dish
out the most damage, and are responsible for
downing enemies quickly. Cleverhearts fill a more
nebulous role of helping allies best fill their own
roles, and hurting the enemies in ways that make
them easier to deal with.
When you reach rank 1, choose one of the
classes and gain the abilities listed with the _Rank 1_
tag. Then, upon reaching rank 2, choose one of the
subclasses your class offers. Each subclass
specializes its own unique play style. For example, a
striker specializes in single targets, while a ravager
specializes in dishing out lots of damage to
everybody.

```
Within each subclass, there are three different
types of abilities: rank 2, rank 3, and rank 4 abilities.
Upon reaching each rank, gain the corresponding
abilities from your subclass.
```

Strongheart

```
Stronghearts are accustomed to taking the brunt
of the damage in a fight. They can survive more hits
than other classes, and do best when they are in the
thick of the fight. They generally have ways of
keeping enemies engaged with them, rather than
threatening their allies. Three types of stronghearts
exist—bastions, wrathguards, and vicehands.

### CLASSES

```
Par t y C om p os i t ion
Heart Rush is a game where every role in
the party will play a critical role in a team fight.
Each class enables or takes advantage of the
synergistic abilities of other classes, so a party
where there is at least one of each class will
almost always perform better than a party that’s
missing one of the core classes. Obviously,
don’t feel like you have to choose a class
because the rest of your party wants to choose
the other classes—it’s just something to keep in
mind.
```

In the Thick of It
_Passive ability. Rank 1._
You excel when in the center of battle. For each
enemy adjacent to you, you get +1 to your attack and
defense rolls.

- Whenever you take damage, gain a rush
  point.
- Damage converts to damage you can attack
  back with
- Counter attacks
- HP as a spendable resource (wrath guard)

Cry of Defiance

_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1._
You shout out, have a moment of inner peace, or
by some other means recenter yourself in the
moment. Choose one:

- Remove all levels of one condition from
  yourself.
- Remove one level of every condition from
  yourself.
- Gain hit points equal to your maximum heart
  die.

Subcl ass: Bastion

_Also known as: Guardian, Knight, Paladin_
A burly woman stands her ground, unyielding as
a wall, shielding the frightened villager behind her.
Each time a wolf leaps, she strikes, knocking them
aside, holding the line and keeping the pack at bay.
Blow after blow rains down on a hulking
minotaur, surrounded by enemies. With a thunderous
roar, he rears up, shaking off the attackers and
sending them sprawling. The flurry of strikes seems
to have left him unscathed.
A young dwarf in heavy armor strides calmly
through the chaos of battle, his massive great
hammer resting on his shoulder. Despite the storm of
blades around him, he remains unscathed, and with a

```
casual swing, he crushes enemies to the ground, as if
at his whim.
Bastions are living fortresses, impenetrable and
unmovable on the battlefield. They step in to shield
their allies, absorb devastating blows, and unleash
retribution on those foolish enough to ignore their
defense.
```

```
Guardian’s Sacrifice
Passive ability. Rank 2.
You have the ability to step in when those nearby
are in a vulnerable position. If a creature adjacent to
you is about to be harmed or attacked, and the attack,
defense, or damage rolls haven't been made yet, you
can choose to intervene and place yourself between
them and the source of harm. If it's an attack, you
make the defense roll and absorb the damage in their
place. If it's unavoidable damage, you can take that
on yourself too. You also have the option to switch
positions with the creature you're protecting. You can
only save one creature during a round, but you can
shield them from multiple sources of damage if
needed.
```

```
Violent Defense
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
You hunker down, presenting a bristling wall of
defense. Until the end of the round, you may add
your weapon die to your defense rolls. If you would
make a defense roll and get a result greater than their
attack roll, the attacker takes damage equal to the
difference as you parry their blow and counterattack.
```

```
Hulking Blows
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Your blows are slow, but absolutely devastating.
After revealing stances, if you are wielding a heavy
melee weapon, you may declare your attack to be a
hulking blow. If you do, choose a creature in the
engagement that you are able to attack. That creature
```

may choose to forfeit all attack rolls during this
engagement and instead automatically dodge your
attack. If they don’t, you may double the result of all
dice from your attack roll.

Eternal Fortitude

_Major ability. Instant. Rank 4._
While others may fall, you fight on—nothing can
bring you to your knees. You may spend any number
of rush points. For each rush point spent, set aside
2d6. Whenever you make a defense roll, before
seeing your result, you may remove and then roll any
number of these dice and add them to your defense
roll.

Subcl ass: Vicehand

A massive orc clad in heavy armor strides
forward, the weight of his presence palpable. With a
swift, calculated movement, he snatches a charging
brigand by the wrist, halting the attack before it
begins. The brigand struggles, but the orc’s grip is
unyielding, yanking the brigand back and away from
his allies.
In the heart of the battlefield, a trollkin stands
firm, surrounded by chaos. With a fierce
determination, she locks onto an enemy warrior,
tackling him to the ground before pummeling him
into a pulp with her fists.
A hulking, bare chested warrior has wrestled a
dire lion to the ground. With terrifying strength, the
warrior begins to constrict the snarling but
completely helpless beast. As the seconds pass, the
snarling becomes weaker and weaker as the life is
squeezed from the mighty beast.
Vicehands are living clamps, expertly trained to
restrain and dominate a single target while shielding
their allies from harm. They thrive in melee combat,
using their strength to hold foes in check and disrupt
enemy plans, ensuring that no threat goes unchecked.

```
Vicehands gain the following abilities.
```

```
Grappler
Passive. Rank 2.
You do not have to directly beat a creature’s
stance to attempt to grapple them. You can grapple as
though you are one size larger than you are.
You have advantage on rolls to grapple other
creatures.
While grappling a creature, your movement
speed is 5 rather than 0.
```

```
Fists, Knees, and Elbows
Minor ability. Rank 3.
Until the end of the round, when you make an
unarmed attack roll against a creature you are
grappling, add your might die to the roll. Grappling
the creature does not impose disadvantage on your
attack rolls against the creature this round.
```

```
I Don’t Think So
Minor ability. Rank 3.
Make a grappling ability check against a creature
you are already grappling. On a success, choose one:
```

- If you are standing, move the grappled creature
  5 feet to a different space adjacent to you.
- The grappled creature cannot make sounds this
  round.
- You and the grappled creature fall prone.
- The creature takes a level of weakened, off-
  balanced, or dazed.

```
Cinch Down
Major ability. Speed. Rank 4
You may only use this ability if you are grappling
a creature. You gain the following benefits so long as
you remain grappling the creature. X is equal to the
number of rush points you spend on this ability.
```

- You get X levels of advantage on checks to
  maintain your grapple on the creature.

### CLASSES

- Each round, as an action, you may roll your
  might die X times and deal that much damage to
  the creature.
- The creature gains X levels of restrained so
  long as they are grappled.

Subcl ass: Wrathguard

_Also known as: Warrior, Sentinel, Barbarian_
A woman stands tall, war-hammer in hand,
daring the snarling werebear to make a move. When
the beast finally lunges, aiming to bypass her and
strike her ally, she reacts with lightning speed,
bringing her hammer down on its back with a
resounding crack, sending it crashing to the ground,
whimpering.
A knight, clad head to toe in gleaming plate mail,
stands firm at the center of the fray. Shield raised,
she swings her mace in wide arcs, keeping half a
dozen goblins at bay. They scramble to dodge her
whirling weapon, only to be cut down by her
advancing allies.
As two armies prepare to clash, a lone figure in
nothing but a kilt and a hammer charges out from the
front lines. Arrows rain down upon him, but he does
not falter. Reaching the enemy’s ranks, he unleashes
a sweeping blow, knocking three soldiers off their
feet, and the battle begins with his roar echoing
across the field.
Wrathguards are fierce, unyielding war
machines, thriving in the heart of combat. They can
withstand punishing blows and return them in kind,
and no matter how battered they are, they rise again,
ready to fight.
Wrathguards gain the following abilities.

Sentinel

_Passive ability. Rank 2._
You are always ready. Sidestepping does not let
enemies avoid your opportunity attacks.

```
Additionally, opportunity attacks do not require an
action or rush points.
```

```
I Didn’t Feel a Thing
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
You are naturally tougher than nearly anyone you
know. You take half as much damage from the next
source of incoming damage, rounded down. If the
source would cause you to move, you move 10 feet
less. If the source would cause you to gain leveled
conditions, you gain those condition at one level
less.
```

```
Crippling Blows
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Your blows are powerful enough to knock people
off their feet. When you deal damage to a creature
with a heavy, melee weapon, choose one:
```

- **Beat Down** : The creature cannot take the
  sidestep action until the beginning of the next
  round. If the creature is no more than one size
  larger than you, it is knocked prone. Otherwise, it
  instead takes two levels of weakened.
- **Smash** : The creature is knocked 10 feet away
  from you.

```
Battle Spirited
Major ability. Instant. Rank 4.
Whenever an ally is attacked by an enemy, you
op attack them.

have attacked you but did not,
Whenever enemy uses its action to start or enter
engagement with anyone besides you...
Whenever an enemy attacks anyone other than
you, attacks you make against that enemy...
```

```
More attacks against more people: any enemy
that attacks an ally gets op attacked
```

- Spend HP? Rewarded for losing HP!
  Rewarded for enemy attacking someone other
  than you. Whenever you take a wound from an
  enemy’s attack, bonus temporarily doubled?
  _- +X each turn from adjacent enemies to attack and defense
  where X is rush points spent._
  Your nearby allies are inspired with the same
  intensity as you are. You may spend any number of
  rush points, and set them aside. Whenever an
  adjacent creature is the target of an attack, you may
  As you attune with the internal melody of
  combat, you and your allies become unstoppable.
  For each rush point spent on this ability, choose one
  of the following effects. The number of times you
  choose a given effect cannot be more than one more
  than the least-chosen effect.
  You and all creatures of your choice within 10
  feet of you gain the benefits of the chosen effects
  until the end of combat. For each ability, replace X
  with the number of total rush points spent.
- Gain 2X hit points at the start of each round
- +X to all defense rolls
- +X to all attack rolls
- Move speed +10X

Battleheart

Battlehearts are best at dealing out lots of
damage. Their abilities grant bonuses that make them
more likely to hit, and more likely to deal more
damage. Two types of battlehearts exist—strikers
and ravagers.

Brutal Attacks
_Passive ability. Rank 1._
Your attacks are vicious and true. Whenever you
roll the maximum result on one of the dice in an
attack roll, or damage from a spell you cast, you may

```
add another die of the same size and roll it, adding it
to the result. This can trigger multiple times.
```

```
Making It Count
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1.
You may apply the effects of your stance twice
during the current engagement.
```

```
Subcl ass: Striker
Also known as: Ranger, Bounty-hunter, Assassin
A lone halfling stands atop a boulder,
overlooking the chaos of the battlefield. In the blink
of an eye, he draws and releases, and another enemy
falls, his arrows swift and unerring.
From the shadows of the rafters, a woman drops
silently onto the false king's back. With a swift,
precise motion, her blade finds its mark, and blood
spills before the king crumples to the floor. In the
next instant, she vanishes, leaving no trace.
An old man perches high in the branches of a
tree, unseen by the caravan below. With quiet
precision, he draws back his bowstring and releases,
sending an arrow straight through the driver's heart,
ending the journey in a single, silent breath.
Strikers are lethal assassins, masters of precision
and efficiency, capable of bringing down even the
mightiest foes with deadly accuracy. Whether
wielding a bow, blade, or any other weapon, Strikers
turn their tools into instruments of death, striking
fear into the hearts of their enemies.
Strikers gain the following abilities.
```

```
Called Shot
Passive ability. Rank 2.
You exchange some defensive ability for
overwhelming offensive prowess. You have
disadvantage on defense rolls, but you may make
called shots.
```

### CLASSES

By aiming for a very specific location on your
target, you maximize your potential damage, at the
risk of dealing less damage if you miss. If you have
advantage on an attack roll, you may declare the
attack to be a called shot.
If you do, announce a target number for you
attack roll. Keep this number in mind for later.
Then, it’s time to determine the multiplier. Your
multiplier starts at one, though you may remove
levels of advantage on your attack roll to increase it.
To increase the multiplier by one, you must sacrifice
a number of levels of advantage equal to the current
level of the multiplier. So to increase the multiplier
to two, you would have to spend one level of
advantage. To then increase it to three, you would
spend two levels of advantage, and so on.
Finally, make your attack roll. If any of the dice
you rolled are equal to or higher than your target
number, multiply your target number by the
multiplier and add that to your attack roll.

```
Power Strike
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Before you announce your stance in an
engagement, you may declare the attack to be a
power strike. If you do, all dice used in the attack
roll trigger your Brutal Attacks ability if they land on
a result greater than half the size of the die. For
example, you would reroll and add another 1d10 to
the result if you rolled a 6-10 on a d10 in your attack
roll.
```

```
Execute
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Whenever you deal damage to a creature, you
may choose for it to be an execution instead. If you
do and if this damage would reduce the creature to
zero or fewer hit points, the creature immediately
dies.
```

```
Devastation Strike
Major ability. Instant. Rank 4.
You deliver a massive blow, potentially finishing
off your enemy. Until the end of the round, you may
use each of your minor abilities once for free. In
addition, you may spend any number of your rush
points to roll 1d6 and add it to your next attack roll
this round. If you do not attack this round, it does not
count as using this ability.
```

```
Subcl ass: Ravager
Also known as: Berserker
A small woman with bloodshot eyes and a
dagger in each hand whirls and dives, darting
between the outstretched arms of her attackers and
skewering them both in the sides as she passes.
A man stands before a horde of goblins, his belt
jammed with nearly a dozen instruments of death.
With a deep breath, the man leaps forward, bringing
his sword down on the head of the first goblin before
```

```
Example (Called Shot)
Let’s say you have four levels of advantage
and you are about to make your attack roll with
1d10, 1d8, and 1d6. If you rolled normally, this
would mean you rolled 1d10 + 1d8 + 5d6, and
then dropped the lowest four. However, you want
to try for more. You decide that you are going to
give up three levels of advantage—one to
increase your multiplier to 2, and two more to
increase it again to 3. You then set your target
number to 5. You then roll your attack with your
one remaining level of advantage: 1d10 + 1d8 +
2d6. You get an 8, 3, 5, and 1. After dropping the
lowest die you have an 8, 5, and 3. Since 8 is
greater than 5, you hit your target and add 5 times
your multiplier of 3—resulting in an additional
15 added to your attack roll of 16 (8 + 5 + 3),
resulting in a 31 total.
```

drawing a hand-axe and throwing it at the second,
before leaping over the head of the next, and driving
an arrow from his quiver into the eye of the last
goblin.
A lithe woman draws forth a paper thin blade of
steel, sharp as a razor. With a short hop, she begins
to move, jumping like lightning from foe to foe,
lopping off heads and severing limbs in an endless
graceful dance that only she can understand.
Ravagers are masters of the horde. They have
learned to wield multiple blades at once, always
capable of choosing the right weapon to gain the
edge in the fight. No battle is too thick for a ravager
to enter, and then leave again with a trail of bloody
corpses in their wake.
Ravagers gain the following abilities.

Everywhere At Once

_Passive ability. Rank 2._
You are capable of combatting multiple enemies
at once. Whenever you enter an engagement, you
may force two enemies to engage rather than just
one.
When you do so, you may make a melee attack
against any number of valid targets in the
engagement rather than only one. If you do not make
any melee attacks, you may instead make a ranged
attack against any number of valid targets in the
engagement who are adjacent to each other.
Additionally, stowing and drawing weapons
counts as a free action, and can be taken at any time,
including between attack rolls.

Li g h t n i n g R e f l e x e s
_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._
Your reflexes are faster than anyone else’s on the
battlefield. During this round, you keep priority after
using abilities. If you choose not to use an ability
while you have priority in this way, priority is still
passed to the other side as usual.

```
Bloodthirsty
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
You can launch from one foe to the next with
grace. When you deal enough damage to cause a
creature go unconscious or die this round, you regain
an action at the end of the engagement (to a
maximum of one). When you attack a creature that
has not been attacked yet this round, you get AD3 on
the attack roll.
```

```
Blitz
Major ability. Rank 4.
The rhythm of your movements synchronizes
perfectly with the fight. Until the end of the round,
you may spend one rush point to make a free
opportunity attack against an enemy and take the
sidestep action. You cannot make an opportunity
attack against the same target more than once.
```

Cleverheart

```
Cleverhearts are best at providing help to their
teammates—either augmenting their attacks, or
debuffing enemies to make their attacks weaker.
Two types of cleverhearts exist—battleminds and
spelltouched.
```

```
Above the Fray
Passive ability. Rank 1.
Although not necessarily the best at dishing out
the damage in a fight, cleverhearts excel at
everything else. Once per round, you may make an
object interaction, sidestep, help, or trip action for
free.
```

```
Tac t i cs
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1.
You can spot out the weak points in your
enemies’ defenses and direct your allies towards
```

### CLASSES

them. Choose a creature within 30 feet. If the

- Creature is adjacent to two or more of your
  allies

Subcl ass: Battlemind

_Also known as: Commander, Mastermind, Tactician_

voice cutting through the chaos as she issues sharp,
precise commands. Beneath her, soldiers move as
one, each order turning the tide of battle further in

eyes watches a pack of wolves approach. With a
swift gesture and a few barked orders, the company
converges, taking down each wolf in turn with
practiced efficiency.
A woman moves gracefully among her allies, her
blade flashing as it strikes her opponent’s shoulder.
With a commanding shout, she rallies her

any combination of up to four creatures and combat
talents you know. The chosen creatures must be
within 120 feet and in earshot. Until the end of this

- Remove all conditions affecting the creature.

Subcl ass: Skirmisher

_Also known as: Rogue, Swashbuckler, Jack of All Trades_
A wiry figure darts between the shadows,
slipping past a lumbering ogre’s sweeping fist. With
a quick flick of the wrist, she throws a handful of
sand into the creature’s eyes, blinding it and slipping
away before it can even roar.
Despite standing amid a dozen pikemen in a
frenzied brawl, a goblin seems to simply melt away
away from the thrusting pikes, evading every swipe
and thrust aimed at him. Then, with a sly grin, he
lashes out, tripping an overzealous soldier and
leaving him sprawled at the mercy of the goblin’
allies.
With a smirk, a tall elven women swishes her
rapier up and flicks the ear of the orc before her.
With a roar, the orc charges forward, but suddenly
the the elf is behind him, pushing him with her boot
into the wall beyond.
Skirmishers are elusive and unpredictable,
dancing around the battlefield with an unsettling
ease. They specialize in dirty tricks and misdirection,
exploiting every weakness to leave their enemies

catch, they disrupt their foes and wear them down
with a series of debilitating strikes.
Skirmishers gain the following abilities.

Improved Interference
_Passive ability. Rank 2._

Choosing the same stance as another creature
does not prevent you from using a non-attacking

```

```

any of the battleheart or cleverheart subclasses with
this subclass instead.

Spelltouched

_Also known as: Gish, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Archer, Spellsword_
A dwarf charges forward, cloaked in flames, his
fists blazing with fiery energy. With a swift motion,
he raises a wall of fire behind the ogre, trapping it,

```
and then strikes with a searing punch, sending the
creature tumbling back in a smoldering heap.
A gnome darts ahead, each step propelled by the
wind itself, carrying her swiftly toward the looming
giant spider. With a graceful twirl of her blade, she
slashes at the creature’s thorax, releasing a
concussive blast of air that hurls it backward.
An elf raises her hand, and a towering wave rises
from the earth, sweeping the fleeing thugs back
toward her. With a sharp stomp, the cobblestone
beneath them seems to melt, dragging the panicked
foes into the ground, immobilized.
Spelltouched blend elemental magic with martial
prowess, wielding their attunements to shape the

## Par ag on A b i l i t i e s

After reaching combat rank 4, further ranks come
in the form of paragon levels. Paragon levels are
awarded to the group at the GM’s discretion, usually
as a reward for a feat of incredible triumph. When
you gain a paragon level, you may gain an ability
from this list.
Paragon levels have tags on them indicating if
there are any limitations on which classes can take
the paragon level. If your class isn’t listed, you can’t
take the paragon level. Additionally, some paragon
levels also have a tag indicating a minimum paragon
level you must be at in order to gain the ability. This
will take the form “PL: X,” where X is the paragon
level you must be at or above.

### PARAGON ABILITIES

```
GM Note
Paragon abilities are on a whole different
level compared to other abilities. They make a
strong character busted. They should only be
given out once you are comfortable with your
players reaching a heroic tier of play, and should
be given out sparingly thereafter.
```

have that creature make a defense roll against
whatever damage you dealt to the previous creature,
and take the difference as damage. This continues so
long as their is another creature you wish to hit
within melee range, and there is damage left over.

Coordinated Efforts

_Passive ability. Subclass: Battlemind._

### PARAGON ABILITIES

## Ta l e n t s

Talents represent specific abilities you have
learned, been gifted, or know how to perform
through religious or magical ritual.
Each talent will fall into one of three types of
abilities: passive abilities, heart abilities, or major
abilities. As with abilities gained from your class,
passive abilities can be used whenever and at no
cost, and major abilities can be used once per day.
Heart abilities, in contrast, can be used again only
after you have taken a short or long rest, or if you
take a wound.
Additionally, talents may also have the _instant_ or
_full action_ tag. If it is _instant_ , then you can use the
ability at literally any time, even right before you
roll. If it has the _full action_ tag, it requires you to use
your action.

Ty p e s o f Ta l e n t s

Several varieties of talents exist, indicated by
their tags. Each require different conditions to be met
in order to gain that talent.

Cognitive and Martial Talents

Martial talents are those that require physical
prowess and training. They represent the cumulation
of extensive practice and training. There are no
prerequisites for taking a martial talent.
Cognitive talents, like martial talents, come from
vigorous training and practice. Likewise, there are no
prerequisites for taking a cognitive talent.

```
Gaeic Melodies
Gaeic melodies are fragments of song that
reverberate throughout all living things—left over
from when Gaea the Earth Mother sang the world
into life.
Gaeic melodies are magical, and listening to
them have magical effects. However, they cannot be
discovered innately, and require a teacher or a
songbook. In addition, you must have a rank 3 or
higher aspect in musical talents in order to play
them.
When playing a gaeic melody, it requires your
action to play the instrument. You can move up to
half your move speed while playing, but cannot
move more than that. You cannot play more than one
gaeic melody at the same time.
```

```
Handmagic
Handmagic uses the power of Deoric to create
their effects. Deoric is the language of truth—where
words spoken in it simply come true.
Handmagic uses Deoric runes tattooed on the
back of one’s hand, inscribed in the blood of magical
creatures to power this life-cost. By articulating the
tattooed hand in specific ways, one can then create
```

```
GM Note
Gaeic melodies and handmagic are rooted in
lore specific to “Alaria”, the world held in mind
during the writing of the Heart Rush rulebook.
Feel free to re-flavor these tags, remove them, or
add new tags and categorizations.
```

those magical effects. The knowledge and necessary
materials to inscribe hand runes is rare and
expensive, and will cost a hefty fee, and likely
require you to be in a city.

Combat Talents

The talents in this section are combat-related
talents. This categorization is for the ease of finding
talents, and has no other effect.

Adrenaline Spike
_Major ability. Handmagic._

Increase the size of an ability die for a single roll.
You can't increase the size of the die beyond a d12.

Destiny Level
Increase the size of the die by two instead, or
increase a d12 to a d20.

Agile
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
When you choose the agility stance, you may
sidestep twice instead of once.

Destiny Level
Whenever you choose this stance, if you declared
this stance the previous round, add 1d6 to all A/D
rolls made this round. Increase the die’s size by one
for each consecutive time you chose this stance.

Assassin
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
You have learned the art of debilitating your foes
and killing them silently. When you enter an
engagement with a humanoid, you may immediately
make a might or agility check against their agility
challenge number. On a success, you either gag
them, garrote them, or in some other way remove
their ability to speak or shout out. They cannot

```
produce sound for the next minute. If the creature is
surprised, you automatically succeed at this check.
Destiny Level
Once per month, you may declare a humanoid to
be the target of your assassination. So long as that
creature never learns you are an assassin, they
remain marked.
Given you spend one month studying the target
of your assassination before attempting to kill them,
you have A5 on opportunity attacks made against
your target, and advantage on all other attacks
against it.
```

```
Back Stab
Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.
If you and another ally are opposite to each other
with an enemy directly between you (you can draw a
line from a single corner of your space to every
corner of the ally’s space such that the line passes
completely through the enemy’s space), and the
enemy has used its action to enter an engagement
with your ally this round, you may treat your weapon
as using a d20 for your next melee attack roll against
that enemy until end of the round. You must be
wielding an ultralight melee weapon to gain the
benefits of this ability.
You may also use this die if you are granted an
opportunity attack because you are hidden.
Destiny Level
You may replace your weapon die with 2d20
instead.
```

```
Baited Attack
Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.
If a creature makes an attack against you and
deals no damage to you, they instead deal damage
equal to their roll to another creature behind you as
you redirect their attack. A creature is considered
behind you if at least one straight line can be drawn
```

### TA L E N T S

from a corner of the attacker’s space, through your
space, and to a corner of the new victim’s space.

Destiny Level
When you use this ability, both creatures gain 2
levels of enraged towards you.

Ballad Of Björn
_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._

After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, you may choose any number of creatures
besides yourself within 60 feet and in earshot. They
lose all levels of frightened and charmed if they had
any, and are immune to both conditions for the next
24 hours.
In addition, they gain the benefits of a short rest,
and gain one additional rush point the next time they
gain rush points today.

Destiny Level
This ability becomes a major ability. You may
include yourself in the creatures affected by your
song.

BattleFrenzy

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
While there are two or more enemies adjacent to
you, you have advantage on your attack roll for each
enemy adjacent to you.

Destiny Level
Whenever you start the round with two or more
enemies adjacent to you, you gain a rush point for
each adjacent enemy.

Battlescreech

_Heart ability. Martial talent._
You emit a horrifying, earsplitting screech,
terrifying and disturbing your enemies. Choose any
number of creatures within 30 feet. Those creatures
get D2 on their next A/D roll.

```
Destiny Level
Those creatures also don’t gain the benefit of the
next stance they choose, and gain two levels of
dazed.
```

```
Battleweave
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you sidestep, you deal damage to an
adjacent creature at your new location equal to twice
the number of enemies you began the round adjacent
to.
Destiny Level
You may choose to either deal twice as much
damage to the target of this ability, or the same
amount of damage to every adjacent enemy.
```

```
Beast Bond
Passive ability. Handmagic. Prerequisite: Beast Companion
You can magically, telepathically communicate
with your companion, and over any distance.
As an action, you may begin sensing through the
senses of your beast companion. You cannot use
your own senses again until you spend an action
returning to your own body.
Destiny Level
As an action, you may take total control of your
beast companion. While in control, you play each
round as the animal instead of yourself. You may use
any cognitive and martial talents you have, but the
cooldowns are not separate for your animal. For
example, once you've used a major ability, you
cannot use it yourself or as your animal until you
take a long rest. You may also cast spells you know
and use your attunements as the animal.
While controlling your companion, your body
falls prone and is incapacitated, and you cannot
sense using your body’s senses. You may return to
your body as an action.
```

Beast Companion
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
Choose an animal with the GM’s approval. It has
a d6/d4/d2/d2 stat block, must be of small size or
smaller, has 20 hit point capacity, and a d6 heart die
(you may work with your GM to adjust these
values). You can communicate simple ideas with it
from a distance using verbal and somatic commands.
The animal obeys all your commands.
When in combat, your companion is not very
effective on its own. Your companion cannot use its
action to enter engagements, though it can still be
forced into engagements by other combatants. It can
otherwise use its action normally.
You may take this talent any number of times.
If your companion dies, you may choose to
replace this talent with another talent instead.

Destiny Level
You may spend XP on your beast companion as
though it were yourself. Beast companions cannot
gain talents as oaths, and cannot gain cognitive
talents. Your beast companion cannot gain a beast
companion.
While adjacent to your companion, if you or your
companion would be forced to make a defense roll,
the other may choose to step in to make the defense
roll and take the damage instead. If that creature was
already being attacked from the same source, they
cannot use this ability.

_Heart ability. Handmagic._

adjacent to you.

```

using this ability.

Bloodoath
Weekly ability. Handmagic.
As an action, you swear vengeance against a
creature that you believe has wronged you. You can
```

### TA L E N T S

only have a bloodoath against one creature at a time.
While you have sworn vengeance against a creature
you always know where the creature is, and
whenever you engage with or make an opportunity
attack against the creature you gain a rush point at
the beginning of the next round.

Destiny Level
You have advantage on A/D rolls against your
sworn enemy. In addition, you do not need to use
your action to use this ability.

Body Shield
_Heart ability. Martial talent._
The next time you are hit by a melee attack from
a source that is adjacent to both you and a creature
you are grappling, if the attacking creature’s stance
did not directly beat your own, you may use the
grappled creature as a body shield. Add the
creature’s defense bonus to your own and split the
damage between you, rounding up.

Destiny Level
You may use this ability against ranged attacks as
well, so long as the grappled creature is between you
and the source (a line can be drawn from one of your
corners to theirs that passes through the grappled
creature’s space).
When you use this ability, the grappled creature
takes all of the damage and makes the defense roll
instead.

Boundless Fury

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
Whenever your attack deals more damage than
the defending creature’s maximum heart die, you
may enter an engagement with a different, adjacent
creature immediately after the current engagement
ends. You cannot attack a creature you have already
attacked this round. After the new engagement, you

```
gain one level of weakened for each time you used
this ability in the round.
Destiny Level
Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points,
your next attack roll deals an additional 1d10
damage.
```

```

two dice in an attack roll, you double each of their

Bu nker Down
Heart ability. Martial talent.
You bunker down, preparing for the worst. You
may only use this ability if you have a shield. When

until the end of the round:
```

- You cannot dash, enter engagements, or make
  attack rolls.
- You must choose the defensive stance if
  someone enters an engagement with you.
- You may treat all defense rolls you make as
  their maximum result.
- When you are pushed, you are pushed half as
  far as you would be otherwise.

  have already made an attack.

using this talent. Additionally, you don’t provoke

as you do not pause or interact with the creature
while within its melee range.

Careful Shot

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
If you didn’t moved in the previous round and
have not moved yet during this round, you may
apply two levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened

condition.

  presence check contested by their cunning challenge
  number. This check is made with disadvantage if
  they are unfriendly or hostile towards you. On a

  information that the target knows and is not actively
  hiding. On a fail, they know that you are fishing for
  information about your topic.
  Destiny Level
  You do not make this check with disadvantage
  against unfriendly creatures, and you make the check
  with advantage if it’s against a friendly or neutral

speak. You may transform back to your original form
at will, or at the end of the round if in combat.

your voice to carry as whispers in the blade of grass
or leaves on the trees to everywhere within the

Every thing Has a Price
Weekly ability. Handmagic.
If you touch someone, you may force them to be
willing to sell any item to you. They will not

certainty for the next 24 hours when they are
bluffing about anything related to prices, markets,
risk, and gambling.

You can only choose each benefit once, and the slots
remain allocated until you reach a location where
you can resupply and change out your equipment.
```

  which direction is North.
- Your shelter counts as indoors for purpose of
  calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.

### TA L E N T S

- Your bed counts as a straw bed for the purpose
  of calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.
  Destiny Level

  grant additional levels of advantage on navigation
  checks, or give other people the benefits of shelter
  and a straw bed.
  Additionally, you have finely tuned your sense
  for where there may be more to discover, and what
  you might find. Once per month, while exploring a
  location unfamiliar to you, you may declare that
  there is more to be discovered. Then name either
  ruin, settlement, or natural wonder, and choose a
  direction that you have not been in before. Whatever
  you named is located somewhat closely in the named
  direction. The GM may ask you to choose a different
  direction, or a different discovery.

knowledge contained in any information you read or
hear.

those around you to it. If you spend ten minutes
talking to a crowd of ten or more, you convert 1/10th
of the people who are at least one level of influence
lower than you into followers.
You have advantage when trying to persuade
your followers to take an action that aligns with your

multiple times.

object that would fit in a space somewhere between a

transformed.

Keen Eye

_Monthly ability. Cognitive talent._
When you make a perception check, you may
declare one thing that is unusual but nearly

notice.

Le t I t G o

choice of permanent physical or permanent mental
vulnerability.
```

```
Master of Espionage
Monthly ability. Cognitive talent.
Whether it be heists, spying, or sabotage, you are
accomplished in the ways of espionage. You may
declare an object as the target of your espionage. If
you spend one day gathering knowledge about the
security around your target, you have advantage on
all rolls related to accessing that object, and then
escaping thereafter.
If you spend one week gathering knowledge
about your target, you may make an “educated
guess” about the security around your target. The
GM will confirm or deny your educated guess with a
simple “yes” or “no”.
Destiny Level
Before you perform your act of espionage, you
may choose to lay out a detailed plan. You must
describe your plan to the GM. While you execute
your espionage, so long as everything goes as
planned, you may choose to replace any roll made
during the heist with the maximum of your relevant
ability die. These benefits do not extend to
contingency plans, nor to tasks that were not clearly
specified in the plan. For example, “Break into the
house” would provide zero bonuses, while “Pick the
lock on the door without making a sound” would
provide bonuses to both picking the lock and to
doing so quietly.
```

### TA L E N T S

Medic

roll a defense roll—you take the full damage—but
the weapon is rendered useless, and cannot be used
again.

Destiny Level
If you have a paragon attunement to earth, you
gain an advanced attunement to iron and steel.

Misty Illusions

_Passive ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental attunement: Water & Air._
You can manipulate the water in the air to create
realistic illusions. Add mist to your resonate
substances as a liquid attunement.

```
As an action, you may make an illusion of a
single object within the range of your mist
manipulation. The illusion cannot be seen through,
and creatures will not realize that it is an illusion
until they have interacted with it in some way, at
which point the illusion fades from their sight.
Illusions can be hidden behind if the illusion is of
another object, though they appear as three
dimensional objects, so they cannot be illusions of
darkness, empty space, or your immediate
surroundings.
If a creature has reason to suspect it is an
illusion, such as if something suddenly appears or
disappears, they may make a cunning check
contested by your cunning challenge number. On a
success, they see through the illusion.
Destiny Level
By agitating the molecules in the air, you can
also cause the illusion to emit realistic sounds of
your choice. You may manipulate the image and
sounds as an object interaction.
```

```
Nature’s Child
Passive ability. Handmagic.
You can sense basic intentions and communicate
simple ideas with wild animals. When you take this

you and you have A3 on all interactions with those
creatures.

As an action, you can summon forth wild
animals in a mile radius. If you have chosen a
specific animal, you gain exclusively that animal
instead.
```

Necromancy
_Major ability. Handmagic._
You can raise the dead. By sacrificing a creature,
you can reanimate another creature of the same type.
The ritual takes one hour, and at the end you have a
creature with stats identical to the dead creature, with
the same might die, d2 cunning, agility, and presence
dice, half of the hit point maximum, and no ability to
communicate. It loses any special combat abilities it
had, and obeys any orders you give it to the best of
its ability. You can have no more than one undead
creature under your control.

Destiny Level
You may create and control up to three undead
servants with this talent.

Observant
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._

In addition, so long as you can see someone’s
lips and understand the language they are speaking,
you know what they are saying, even if you can’t
hear them.

Destiny Level
Hidden attackers cannot make opportunity
attacks against you, you do not suffer any penalty
from attacking an obscured enemy, and obscured
enemies gain no advantage when attacking you.
In addition, if you spend your action watching a
creature fight for three rounds or more, you learn the
creature’s strengths and weaknesses, and have
advantage on all A/D rolls made against that
creature.

Oracle
_Monthly ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may choose a creature other
than yourself. That creature’s next roll is replaced
with the maximum result on each of the dice, and a

```
complication occurs. At any time, the GM may
replace any one of your next rolls with the minimum
possible result. It cannot be rerolled or replaced. The
GM may not do so again until you use this ability
again.
Destiny Level
This no longer takes an action.
```

```
Pinky Swear
Passive ability. Handmagic.
While the smallest finger of your hand is
interlocked with the smallest finger of another
person’s hand, neither you nor that person can
knowingly utter a lie.
Destiny Level
While your fingers are intertwined, both people
are compelled to speak truthfully. They cannot
withhold information.
```

```
Poisoner
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
So long as you can disguise it as another action,
you automatically succeed on any check to slip
poison into someone’s food or drink, even while in
plain sight of them. This does not guarantee that they
will not notice there is poison in their food, only that
they will not realize that you are poisoning the food
as you do it.
For every 10 times you digest a single type of
poison, you develop a slightly higher tolerance for it,
and take 10 damage less from every instance of
damage it deals.
Destiny Level
You know your poisons. You immediately know
if any food or drink you eat contains any poison, as
well as all of its properties.
```

### TA L E N T S

Rapid Growth
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, you may place your hand on a non-
living object that fits in a space somewhere between
a 10-foot cube and a 2-inch cube. The object grows

transformation lasts for one hour, or until dismissed
as an action.

may not use this ability on more than three different
objects at once. The upper limit of the size increases
to at 25-foot cube.

choose two new objects.

Destiny Level
You may choose up to 5 objects, and the
repulsive force begins at 100 feet away.

Rope Servant

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
If a single piece of rope is held in your hands, it
can be controlled in any way you wish, as if it were
an extension of your arm, including floating straight
up. It is not strong or dexterous enough to wield a
weapon. The control persists only while you hold the
rope. The rope can be of length up to 50 feet.

Destiny Level
The rope becomes unbreakably strong while
being held, and it can extend up to 200 feet long.

```
Ru nescribe
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
If you have aspect 4 or higher in runescribing or
a similar aspect, you may now begin making
handmagic signs. If you spend a week studying and
practicing with a sign that you can readily see, you
can memorize that sign and tattoo hands with that
sign in the future. It requires 1 oz of titan blood and
titan bone, which equates to about half the price of
getting a new handmagic sign.
Destiny Level
If you have aspect 5 or higher in runescribing or
a similar aspect, you may make the additional
modifications to a handmagic sign to make its
destiny level upgrade. You must spend a week
studying and practicing before memorizing and
inscribing the destiny level version of a sign.

to 10 feet, and will not pull their gaze from you.

roll, you may choose to instead use the maximum
result of your presence die rather than rolling.

Song of Rage

_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._
After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, you may choose a creature within 60 feet and
in earshot. It feels an inexplicable dislike towards a

Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
You have a network of spies and informants at
your fingertips. Once per day while within a city
within the range of your influence, you may meet
with your informants to learn what is going on
around town. You may ask two unique questions of
the GM. If you meet with them again after a day or
more, your spies return with answers. The GM
answers one of your questions truthfully, and either
gives false information about the other, or else
doesn’t answer it at all. Any information that fewer
than 25 people know about cannot be answered by
your spy network.
Destiny Level
You may ask up to three questions, and may ask
questions with answers that are known by no fewer
than five people. The GM must truthfully answer
two of the three questions.
```

### TA L E N T S

Smell Something Fishy
_Heart ability. Cognitive talent._
When investigating the location of a mystery or
crime, you may ask the GM if there are any
undiscovered clues related to a question of your
choice about whatever event occurred in your
location. The GM must answer truthfully.

Destiny Level
When investigating a mystery or crime, or when
interrogating a suspect, you may posit a hypothesis
about what happened to the GM. Then, the GM rolls
a d4 in secret. On a 2, 3, or 4, the GM must nod their
head if you are right, and shake their head if you are
wrong. On a 1, the GM must do the opposite.

Stargazer

_Weekly ability. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, if you can see the stars, you may
use this ability. You may ask one yes or no question
about the past or present.
The GM will do their best to answer your
question.

Destiny Level
You may instead use this ability to ask an open
ended question with a one-word answer. Roll 1d10.
On a 8, 9, or 10, the GM must answer truthfully with
one word.

Tw o-Faced

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
You have two faces, your natural face and a
second face with features you decide, which you can
switch between by passing a hand over your face.
The second face is always the same face. It requires
an action to perform this ability.

Destiny Level
Your face can change to any face you’ve seen
before when you use this ability.

```
Voice Actor
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
You gain the following abilities:
```

- You can imitate voices nearly perfectly.
- You can produce any sound you have heard
  before, so long as it is within your normal vocal
  volume.
  A CN 12 cunning check will reveal imperfections
  in your imitation.
  Destiny Level
  You gain the following additional abilities:
- You can speak and produce sound without
  moving your mouth or lips.
- You can throw your voice up to 15 feet.
  The CN for identifying your mimicry increases
  to a 14.

```
Waltz of the Weissenkauer
Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.
You play a macabre and sinister tune. After
playing your instrument for a minute or more, all
creatures within 60 feet and in earshot gain one level
of frightened towards you for the rest of the day.
Destiny Level
You may choose for them to gain three levels of
frightened instead, and you may choose to exempt
creatures from the effects.
```

```
Wor ldly Tr av e le r
Monthly ability. Cognitive talent.
You have traveled the world and met many, many
people. When you meet someone who the GM
describes as someone you’ve never met, you may
choose to claim some connection to them. If you do,
the GM will explain how you recognize them, and
the nature of your connection. This connection may
be as distant as “you saw them drinking in a bar in a
neighboring country”, or as close as, “this woman
bears a strong resemblance to the thief you killed
```

earlier today, and you suspect she is his sister”. It is
possible there is no feasible connection between you
and this person. In this case, you may either regain
the use of this ability, or take three destiny points.
You cannot use this ability to claim connections with
people more influential than yourself.

Destiny Level
Rather than claim a connection to someone you
meet, you may use this ability before actually
running into someone. For example, while at a bar in
a foreign country, you could claim that you knew a
weapon enchanter who lived in this area. If the GM
also believes this to be plausible, your connection
becomes real (though their location and condition
may have changed since the last time you talked with
them). If the GM doesn’t believe this to be
reasonable, you may choose not to use this ability.

### TA L E N T S

## Weapons, Cantrips & Armor

Equipment encompasses all of the gear you
might use while adventuring. When you first create
your character, you will likely start out with a
weapon and some armor, though it is up to the GM.
Also in this section are the rules for cantrips.
Cantrips are very similar to weapons; you choose
stances, and on a hit you usually get to make an
attack roll with your chosen stance. Cantrips differ
from weapons in that there is no physical weapon
used to strike the opponent, and only those with
magical attunements can use them.

Weapons

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and
damage type, which together describe the weapon
and its properties. You may choose one weapon to be
your primary weapon. This weapon does not use up
equipment slots.
You can only wield one weapon at a time. If
wielding a weapon does not require being held in
your hands, it does not count towards this restriction.

Size

The size of weapon refers to how big and
powerful the weapon is. Three sizes exist: heavy,
light, and ultralight or improvised. It is up to the GM
to determine the size of any given weapon.

Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons require two hands, can only be
wielded by creatures of size medium or larger, and
cannot be easily hidden upon your body. Longbows,

```
long swords, pikes, mauls, and heavy crossbows are
examples of heavy weapons. Whenever you use a
heavy weapon, add 1d12 to your attack rolls. Your
move speed decreases by 5 feet if this weapon is not
part of your body. Heavy weapons use 10 gear slots
unless they are your primary weapon or part of your
body.
```

```
Li g h t W e a p o n s
Light weapons are, as their name suggests, light,
and are easy to handle. Crossbows, shortswords, and
shortbows are all examples of light weapons.
Whenever you use a light weapon, add 1d8 to your
attack rolls. Light weapons use 5 gear slots unless
they are your primary weapon or part of your body.
```

```
Ultralight Weapons
Ultralight weapons are small and easy to handle.
Knives, shurikens, and claws count as ultralight
weapons. Whenever you use an ultralight weapon,
add 1d4 to your attack roll. Ultralight weapons use 2
gear slots unless they are your primary weapon or
are part of your body.
```

```
Improvised Weapons
Chairs, your teeth, and your falling body can all
be weapons in the right context. Improvised weapons
count as ultralight weapons unless indicated
otherwise.
```

```
At tack Ty pe
Two types of weapons exist: melee and ranged.
Each come with different benefits.
```

Melee

Melee weapons are weapons that do not involve
any part of the weapon leaving your hand. They are
generally more powerful than ranged weapons, due
to the fact that they have a lot of weight attached to
them. Heavy melee weapons require two hands, and
light and ultralight melee weapons require only one.
Melee weapons have a range of 5 feet.
**Might Stance Bonus** : You may push the
defending creature 10 feet away from you after
everyone in the engagement has made their might
attack roll. You may enter any of the free spaces they
left or passed through because of your attack.
Moving into that space does not provoke opportunity
attacks.

Ranged

Ranged weapons trade damage for being able to
inflict injuries from a safer distance. Light ranged
weapons have a range of 30 ft, and heavy ranged
weapons have a range of 60 ft. You can attack targets
outside of that range, but have disadvantage to the
attack for every 10 feet beyond the range listed, to a
maximum of double the weapon’s range.
Ranged weapons come with drawbacks,
however. All ranged weapons require two hands
unless specifically noted otherwise, and you cannot
choose anything but the defensive stance if you
move more than half of your move speed (after
accounting for armor and other penalties) during a
round, and cannot move more than half your move
speed (after accounting for armor and other
penalties) if you already took a non-defensive stance
in an engagement.
**Might Stance Bonus** : Creatures defending
against this attack cannot add their defense bonus
from armor to their defense roll.

```
Th row n
Thrown weapons are a special category of
weapons that combine elements of both melee and
ranged combat. They behave similarly to melee
weapons in terms of handling but are used up as they
are thrown. Thrown weapons have a range of 20 feet.
You can attack targets outside of that range, but have
disadvantage on the attack for every 5 feet beyond
the range listed, to a maximum of double the
weapon’s range.
Unless otherwise stated, only ultralight weapons
can be thrown. Weapons cannot be thrown in water.
Might Stance Bonus : The first time you hit with
a thrown weapon attack in an engagement, you may
make an immediate follow-up attack with another
thrown weapon against a different valid target in the
engagement.
```

```
Whip
Whips have a range of 20 feet. Unless otherwise
stated, only ultralight weapons can be whips.
Whips cannot be used in water.
Might Stance Bonus : Add another weapon die
to your attack roll.
```

Damage Type

```
Bludgeoning
Bludgeoning weapons use raw force to inflict
damage, and therefore are best used with high might.
Examples of bludgeoning weapons include war
hammers and clubs. Whenever you wield a
bludgeoning weapon and use the might stance, add
an additional weapon die to your roll.
```

```
Slashing
Slashing weapons use accuracy and dexterity to
inflict damage, and therefore are best used with high
agility. Examples of slashing weapons include
```

### WEAPONS, CANTRIPS & ARMOR

swords and scythes. Whenever you wield a slashing
weapon and use the agility stance, add an additional
weapon die to your roll.

Piercing

Piercing weapons use knowledge of your
opponents maneuvering to inflict damage, and
therefore are best used with high cunning. Examples
of piercing weapons include rapiers and weapons
that use arrows. Whenever you wield a piercing
weapon and use the cunning stance, add an
additional weapon die to your roll.

Other Weapon Tags

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and
damage type. However, weapons can also have tags,
making them further distinct.

Reach

Melee weapons can have this tag. If you haven’t
dashed this round, the range of this weapon is 10 feet
instead of 5. If you attack a creature at this extended
range, you cannot dash this round.

Cantrips

Cantrips are very similar to normal weapons.
They can be melee or ranged, and heavy, light, or
ultralight, and they can be cast any time you would
normally make an attack with a weapon. However,
unlike weapons, you can only use a cantrip if you
have an attunement to the corresponding element.
Also, since elemental attacks are not always
physical, they don't always deal damage, and the
bonus granted by the might stance is sometimes
different.
There are two types of cantrips—bolts, and
blasts. Bolts are arcs of energy that shoot in a line

```
from your hand, while blasts are short bursts of
energy emitted from the caster themselves. Each
have more specific rules outlined in their sections.
```

```
Bolts
Bolts are individual streaks of elemental energy
or matter that are fired from a single hand. They
behave similarly to ranged weapon attacks, though
they do not get a bonus from damage type. All bolt
cantrips have a range of 30 feet at basic attunement
to that element, 60 feet at advanced attunement, and
120 feet at paragon attunement.
```

```
Li g h t n i n g B o l t
Air.
You shoot a crackling bolt of lightning from your
hand. This attack deals damage as an ultralight,
ranged, spell-weapon attack. If the target is wearing
metal armor or is wet, double the result of your
attack roll.
```

```
Fire Bolt
Fire.
You shoot a bolt of fire from your hand. This
attack does no damage, but ignites the target, dealing
2 levels of burning.
Might Stance Bonus : Add a level of burning.
```

```
Why Are Cantrips Near the Weapon
Section?
Conceptually, cantrips and weapons are
obviously different. However, the rules for
spells are similar to ranged weapons. Unlike
spells, they are used during engagements in the
same way as weapons. People with attunements
can use them like “utility” arrows, where each
type of bolt and blast has some convenient
effect, possibly in addition to damage.
```

Wat e r B olt
_Water._
You may shoot a heavy jet of water from your
hand. This attack deals damage as a light, ranged,
bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack. On a hit, the
target is drenched in water, and takes a level of off-
balanced.

Earthen Bolt
_Water._
You may launch a massive stone from your hand.
This attack deals damage as a heavy, ranged,
bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack.

Force Bolt

_Force._
You shoot a roiling bolt of force from your hand.
This attack does no damage, but the target is pushed
back 20 feet.
**Might Stance Bonus** : They are pushed 30 feet
instead.

Void Bolt
_Void._
You shoot a bolt of pure void from your hand.
The faint sound of faesong can be heard in the air as
the bolt travels. This attack does no damage, but the
target takes a level of confused as faesong rips
through their body.
**Might Stance Bonus** : Add a level of confused.

Dark Bolt
_Dark._
You shoot a bolt of darkness from your hand.
This attack does no damage, but the target takes 2
levels of weakened as their skin is chilled to the
bone.
**Might Stance Bonus** : Add two levels of
weakened.

```
Radiant Bolt
Light.
You shoot a bolt of brilliant light from your hand.
This attack does no damage, but the target takes 2
levels of blinded as light ripples across their body.
Might Stance Bonus : Add a level of blinded.
```

```
Ti me B olt
Time.
You shoot a bolt of time from your hand. This
attack does no damage but the target takes a level of
stunned as time temporarily freezes for the creature.
Once a creature has been stunned from a time
effect, it is immune until 24 hours have passed.
Might Stance Bonus : Add two levels of dazed.
```

```
Blasts
Blasts are outbursts of an element centered on
one’s self, generally taking the form of a rapidly
expanding circle of elemental matter or energy. They
behave similarly to melee weapon attacks, in that
you must choose a stance, can only attack those
whom your stance beats, and gain the benefits
associated with each stance—though not all blasts
deal damage, and not all blasts are attacks. You must
have both hands free to use blast cantrips.
After choosing a stance, blast cantrips affect up
to two valid targets of your stance within 5 feet of
you. At advanced attunement, the cantrip affects any
number of valid targets in range. At paragon
attunement, the range of your blast increases by 5
feet.
```

```
Blast of Lightning
Air.
You spread your arms, sending electricity
crackling away from you. This attack deals damage
as an ultralight, melee, spell-weapon attack. If targets
```

### WEAPONS, CANTRIPS & ARMOR

are wearing metal armor, double the result of your
attack roll.

Blast of Fire
_Fire._
You spread your arms, radiating large waves of
fire. This attack does no damage, but the target is
ignited, taking two levels of burning.
**Might Stance Bonus** : Add a level of burning.

Blast of Water
_Water._
You spread your arms, sending a short but
powerful wave of water away from you. This attack
deals damage as a light, melee, bludgeoning, spell-
weapon attack. On a hit, targets are drenched in
water, and take a level of off-balanced.

Blast of Earth
_Earth._

You spread your arms, hurling rocks away from
you. This attack deals damage as a heavy, melee,
bludgeoning, spell-weapon attack.

Blast of Force
_Force._
You spread your arms, emitting a blast of
pressure. This attack does no damage, but targets are
pushed back 20 feet.
**Might Stance Bonus** : They are pushed 30 feet
instead.

Blast of Void
_Void._
You spread your arms, launching thousands of
grains of pure void. This attack does no damage, but
targets take a level of confused as faesong rips
through their body.
**Might Stance Bonus** : Add a level of confused.

```
Blast of Darkness
Dark.
You spread your arms, engulfing yourself and the
area around you in rippling darkness. This attack
does no damage, but targets take two levels of
weakened as they are sapped of their energy by the
the shadowy tendrils engulfing them.
Might Stance Bonus : Add two levels of
weakened.
```

```
Blast of Radiance
Light.
You spread your arms, emitting brilliant white
light. This attack does no damage, but targets take
two levels of blinded as light engulfs them.
Might Stance Bonus : Add a level of blinded.
```

```
Blast of Time
Time.
You spread your arms, causing time to distort
around you. This counts as a light, melee, spell-
weapon attack. On a hit, this attack does no damage,
but the target takes a level of stunned as time
temporarily freezes for the creature.
Once a creature has been stunned from a time
effect, it is immune until 24 hours have passed.
Might Stance Bonus : Add two levels of dazed.
```

Armor

```
Armor works by increasing your defense rolls,
making it harder for damage to get through. Armor,
as with other clothing, does not require equipment
slots while being worn.
```

```
Heavy Armor
Add 6 to your defense rolls. Your move speed
decreases by 15 feet. Heavy armor uses 30 slots
unless it is being worn.
```

Medium Armor

Add 4 to your defense rolls. Your move speed
decreases by 10 feet. Medium armor uses 10 slots
unless it is being worn.

Li g h t A r m o r

Add 2 to your defense rolls. Your move speed
decreases by 5 feet. Light armor uses 5 slots unless it
is being worn.

No Armor

There is no bonus or penalty for having no
armor.

Natural Armor

Some creatures have natural armor. Natural
armor can provide any amount of bonus to one’s
defense rolls, and applies no movement speed
penalty. You cannot choose to have natural armor.

Shields

Like armor, shields help you stay alive. You must
have a free hand available to wield a shield (e.g.
wielding a light melee weapon in the other hand).

Heavy Shields

Add 2 to your defense rolls. Your move speed
decreases by 5 feet.
Additionally, other allies may treat your space as
a wall for the purpose of talents and abilities that
refer to adjacent walls.
Heavy shields require 10 gear slots when not
being worn.

Light Shields

```
Add 1 to your defense rolls.
```

```
Light shields require 5 gear slots when not being
worn.
```

### WEAPONS, CANTRIPS & ARMOR

## Kethic Elementalism

Kethic elementalism, also known as Kethic and
elemental magic, is one of the most prevalent
systems of magic. Its basis is in one of attunement.
By understanding a fundamental element completely,
and having a primal bond with that thing, one can
develop power to control that element. As that bond
and understanding grows, one’s power over that
element grows.
There are nine fundamental elements: earth, air,
fire, water, light, dark, force, time, and void. With
these elements, nearly everything is created.
By attuning to different elements, you have some
basic power over those elements. There are three
different levels of attunement for each element—
each of which grant you increasing abilities.
However, attuning to an element is difficult.
Most people never attune to any elements in their life
times, and your spirit must be able to handle the
additional pressure of resonating with the your
attuned element. Those who do will frequently do so
by accident after an unusual or extreme exposure to
one of these such elements. More advanced
attunements require even more exposure, and
paragon level attunements generally require special
activity dedicated to developing an attunement to
that element.
Kethic also comes with limitations. Every living
thing has some very low level attunement with all
the elements, and for this reason, it is nearly
impossible for another creature to interfere with
elements especially close to another living being,
such as its blood or flesh.

Resonate

Substances

```
One of the primary forms of elemental
manipulation is through attunement to resonate
substances. These are the collection of materials that
you have control over. Different types of substances
have different rules dictating your affinity to them at
different levels, however. For example, a master of
earth still won't be able to create as much stone as an
equally skilled master of air can create breathable air
—the solid stone is just fundamentally more difficult
to work with.
The limitations to your control over different
types of substances is listed in the following
sections. There are three different categories of
substances: solids, liquids, and gasses.
```

Solids

```
Manipulation
You can physically manipulate the shape and
form of the substance with your hands as though it
was clay. It is about as fast as literally shaping
something out of clay.
Advanced Attunement
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 15 feet. You do not have to
physically touch the material to shape it. Even
though your hands are not touching the material,
```

their movements control the manipulation as though
the solid was in your hands.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 45 feet.

Sensing

You can sense the direction and approximate
shape and size of the substance within 15 feet, even
if you can’t see them. Your approximations are in 5-
foot cube increments.

Advanced Attunement
The range of your sensing increases to 45 feet.
For substances that you can hold in your hands, you
can sense precise details as though your were
looking through it.

```
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your sensing increases to 120 feet.
```

Creation & Destruction

As an action, you can create or destroy up to a 1-
foot cube of the substance in your hands. If digging a
passage way in this way, you can burrow a humanoid
sized hole a rate of 1 foot per minute. When creating
this solid, it is created in shapeless, 1-foot cubes, and
require further action to shape them further.

Advanced Attunement
You can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in
your hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of
2 feet per minute.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
You can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in
your hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of
5 feet per minute.

Li q u i d s

```
Manipulation
As an action, you can crudely manipulate the
flow of the substance in a 15 foot range around you,
such as creating eddies or a current in one direction
or another. Currents you create can be up to 2 miles
per hour. Additionally, you can hold up to a 1-foot
cube of it in your hands without a container.
Advanced Attunement
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 45 feet. You can cause currents of
up to 4 miles per hour.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 120 feet. You can cause currents of
up to 6 miles per hour.
```

```
Movement
While in this substance, your swim speed is
increased by 10 feet.
Advanced Attunement
While in this substance, your swim speed is
increased by 20 feet. Additionally, you can walk on
this substance.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
While in this substance, your swim speed is
increased by 40 feet.
```

```
Sensing
You can sense the direction of the substance
within 120 feet, even if you can’t see it. Your
approximations are in 20-foot cube increments.
Advanced Attunement
The range of your sensing increases to 300 feet.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your sensing increases to 900 feet.
```

### ELEMENTAL MAGIC

Creation & Destruction

You can create or destroy up to a 1-foot cube of
the substance in your hands as an action.

Advanced Attunement
You can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in
your hands as an action.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
You can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in
your hands as an action.

Gasses

Manipulation

As an action, you can crudely manipulate the
flow of the substance in a 15 foot range around you,
such as creating eddies or a current in one direction
or another. Currents you create can be up to 10 miles
per hour.

Advanced Attunement
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 45 feet. You can cause air speeds
up to 20 miles per hour.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 120 feet. You can cause air speeds
up to 40 miles per hour.

Movement

While in this substance, you fall at a rate of 50
feet per round, and may travel 5 feet for every 5 feet
you fall, up to 30 feet of lateral movement. You take
half fall-damage if you fall through this substance.
You can jump up to 10 feet in the air while in this
substance, and over creatures size medium and
smaller.

Advanced Attunement
While in this substance, you fall at a rate of 25
feet per round, and may travel 10 feet for every 5

```
feet you fall, up to 60 feet of lateral movement. You
take no fall damage from falling.
You can jump up to 15 feet in the air while in this
substance, and over creatures size large and smaller.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
You gain a fly speed of 30 feet (affected by
armor and other movement penalties as well). You
ascend at half speed.
```

```
Sensing
You can sense the direction of the substance
within 120 feet, even if you can’t see it. Your
approximations are in 20-foot cube increments.
Advanced Attunement
The range of your sensing increases to 300 feet.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your sensing increases to 900 feet.
```

```
Creation & Destruction
You can cause this substance to slowly appear or
disappear from around you as an action. If this
substance causes a condition such as blindness or
suffocation, it can be produced at a maximum of a
single level. You can produce a 5-foot cube once
each round as an action, and in no more than a 5-foot
radius from you. You cannot create or destroy in air-
tight locations, including within liquids. Gasses
dissipate after a minute, or immediately if blown
away with a breeze.
Advanced Attunement
You can create or destroy up to a 10-foot cube as
an action instead, and in a 15 foot radius.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
You can create or destroy up to a 15-foot cube as
an action instead, and in a 45 foot radius.
```

Converting Between

Substances

Sometimes, you will be able to convert between
different types of substances, such as with ice and
water, or lava and stone. These conversions use the
following rules.
Conversions happen at a rate equal to twice the
creation rate of whatever substance you are turning it
into, and at a range equal to the corresponding
manipulation range.
For example, with an advanced attunement to a
solid, you can create a 1.5-foot cube as an action. If
you are instead turning a liquid into a solid, you can
create a 2-foot cube of solid as an action, and you
can do it at a range of 15 feet.
If you instead were converting that solid into a
liquid at an advanced level, you would have the
same increase in volume, but would instead be able
to do it at a range of 45 feet, since that is the
advanced liquid manipulation range.

Tr a pp i n g a C r e a t u r e

If you try to convert the substance a creature is
standing in into a solid, it is usually slow enough that
the creature can escape becoming trapped, unless it
already cannot move.

The Ele me n t s

There are nine different elements—fire, air,
water, earth, light, dark, force, void, and time. When
you have a level of attunement with an element, you
gain all of its benefits, as well as the benefits from
every level before it. Gaining attunements to
elements is also one of the primary ways to gain
attunements to resonate substances. You can gain an

```
elemental attunement with the Elemental Affinity
talent, found in the Talents section.
```

Fire

```
Basic Attunement
```

- As an action, you can ignite or put out small
  flames within 5 feet without touching them.
- You can sense any fire within 45 feet,
  including how much, its general direction, and
  intensity.
- You take half damage from the burning
  condition.

```
Advanced Attunement
```

- Add ash to your resonate substances as a basic,
  solid attunement.
- Add smoke to your resonate substances as a
  basic, gaseous substance attunement. Smoke blinds
  and suffocates those who stand in it.
- As an action, you can ignite or put out
  flammable items within 45 feet.
- You can sense fire within a 300 feet, including
  how much, its general direction, and intensity.
- You are immune to the burning condition.

```
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
```

- Add lava rocks, such as pumice and obsidian to
  your resonate substances at basic, solid substance
  attunements.
- Your attunements to ash and smoke become
  advanced.
- As an action, you can ignite or put out
  flammable items within 120 feet.
- As an action, you can manipulate all fire and
  smoke within 120 feet into shapes, patterns, and
  different colors.

Void

```
Basic Attunement
```

- As an action, you may cease to exist, and
  disappear. When you do so, choose any length of

  passing through it when you return, those objects
  are now passing through you—potentially killing
  you.

```
Advanced Attunement
```

  you touch into the void, causing it to cease to exist
  forever. The object must not be larger than a 1-foot

### ELEMENTAL MAGIC

```
A Note on Light and Dark
It’s hard to actually “hurt” someone with
light or darkness. Many of the other elements
have physical aspects or obvious connections to
sources of damage, but light and dark do not.
You’ll notice in the spell sections that spells
with the light and dark tags only deal damage
when they’re paired with another element.
```

Advanced Attunement

- The range of your darkvision increases by 30
  feet.
- The range at which you can create darkness
  increases by 30 feet.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t

- Other creatures with darkvision cannot see
  through darkness you create.
- The range at which you can create darkness
  increases by 60 feet.

Force

Basic Attunement

- As an action, you can apply up to 10 pounds of
  force to any non-living object within 90 feet. You
  can manipulate fine objects, so long as they only
  require one, linear force applied to them.

Advanced Attunement

- The force you can apply increases to a
  maximum of 20 pounds.
- You may divide this force between up to three
  different objects.
- You can manipulate fine objects that would not
  otherwise require a skill check to manipulate, and
  can apply rotational force.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t

- You may divide this force between any number
  of different objects.
- You may manipulate objects that would require
  a skill check to use. You cannot wield a weapon
  using this force.

Spellcasting

Gaining Spells

Learning a spell represents mastery over some
aspect of one’s connection with an element, allowing
the user to perform some fantastical feat. Anyone
with an attunement can learn to cast a spell.
By spending XP, as described in the Gaining and
Spending XP section, one can gain a new spell,
chosen from the list of spells in the Spells section.
You must have at least a basic attunement to all of
the elements in the tags listed below each spell in
order to learn that spell.

Casting Spells

Casting a spell is more difficult than simple
elemental manipulation performed with just an
attunement, as it requires more precise control for a
longer duration. Performing a powerful act of
elemental control while in the thick of a fight takes
skill and practice, and comes with the following
restrictions:

- Casting a spell requires your action.
- You may cast only one spell per round.
- Casting a spell requires at least one free hand
- If casting a spell, you cannot have moved more
  than half your movement speed (after accounting
  for armor and other penalties), rounded up.
- After casting the spell, you cannot move more
  than half your movement speed (after accounting
  for armor and other penalties).
  Casting spells is strenuous, and takes a toll on
  your body, and without proper preparation, can
  wreak havoc on your ability to channel your
  attunement in that way again for a while. You must
  wait four long rests before casting that spell again,
  though that time may vary as per the following rules:
- Subtract one long rest for each consecutive
  round taken before this action spent unmoving,
  taking no actions and using no abilities, and not
  communicating (in complete, meditative
  concentration).
- Subtract one long rest if you have an advanced
  attunement with the elemental type of the spell you
  are casting.
- Subtract two long rests if you instead have a
  paragon attunement with the elemental type of the
  spell you are casting.
  If the total number of long rests would be
  reduced to zero, you must still wait at least one short
  rest before casting the spell again.

```
Spellcasting Ability
Whenever a creature has to make a saving throw
against your spellcasting ability, it must make a
check against the maximum of your current heart
die, plus two times your paragon level.
```

Spells

```
Spells are listed by their name, along with two
tags—their required attunements, and if they are
ongoing or immediate. Most spells have only a
single attunement as prerequisite for casting the
spell, but some have two or more. If the spell is
immediate, the spell effect occurs once when the
spell is cast. If the spell is ongoing, the spell’s effects
continue for up to one minute, or when the spell
caster chooses to end the spell as an instant ability.

immense flames to grow up where you point. Choose
a point within 45 feet and draw a straight line up 20
feet in length starting from that point. A wall of fire
grows up there. Anyone who passes through the fire
takes three levels of burning. The fire does not
spread, and disappears when the spell ends.

Wall of Stone
_Earth. Ongoing._
By drawing a line with your finger, you cause
stone walls to shoot up from the ground where you
point. Choose a point within 45 feet and draw a
straight line up to 20 feet in length starting from that
point. A wall of rock grows up there, 10 feet high.
Each wall segment can take 30 damage before
disintegrating, and has a flat 15 defense.

War pspac e

_Void. Ongoing._
By dragging at the seams separating the void
from the material world, you allow some of it to spill
over. Certain spaces become areas of warped space.
Choose six unoccupied spaces within 45 feet. Each
space ceases to exist. It costs no movement speed to
cross that space, and all spaces adjacent to a warped

```
space are considered adjacent to all other spaces
adjacent to that and any other connected warped
spaces.
```

## Kin & Culture

When you create a character, choose a race, and
if available, an associated heritage within that race.
Your race is your literal species of sentient creature,
while your heritage describes the collective identity,
history, and culture you belong to. Heritages come
and go with the millennia, and transform over time,
while a race will stay the same.
Many races have multiple heritages to choose
from. This stems from their relative profusion across
thew world. Races with fewer heritages, or only one
heritage are less prolific, and therefore lack the same
levels of variety.
When you choose your race and heritage, you
gain all of the aspects and abilities granted by your
choices. The aspects from your race and heritage are
suggestions for that group, but you are welcome to
choose different aspects, so long as you make sure
you have a clear idea of why _you_ are different from
the rest of your community.
The races and heritages are listed at the end of
this book because they are the easiest to be added to.
If you have an idea for a new race or heritage for
your group, don’t hesitate to reach out to the GM and
propose your idea. Each race and heritage
combination adds up to about 2.5-3 talents worth of
power.

```
GM Note
The races listed in this chapter are a small
selection of the races that exist in the author’s
own campaign setting. But you should create
your own—it’s easy! Every race is just two
aspects, and two abilities that are each about as
powerful as a talent.
```

Human

Humans are resilient and abundant. They are far
the most prolific across Alaria, and have the greatest
breadth of culture. Contributing to their success as a
species is their perseverance; just when you think
you’ve knocked one down for good, they’re back up
for more.

Vitals

- Size: Medium
- Height: 5-6.5 feet
- Weight: 100-180 pounds

Human Resilience and Diversity
_Passive ability._

When you gain this ability, choose one talent.
You gain this talent as a racial ability (it does not
count towards the number of talents you have).
In addition, whenever you take a wound, you
gain a rush point at the start of the next round.

Drachma

Drachma are fierce, passionate, and boisterous,
and place a high emphasis on valor, panache, and
following ones instincts. They are usually the first
one you notice when walking into a room—both for
their striking, long, shiny black hair that many of
them maintain, as well as their sociable personalities.
It is hard to feel unwelcome when around Drachma.
Drachma are generally found in western regions
of Alaria, along the coasts, and are known for their
pirates, merchants, and swindlers, as well as their
hearty Drachman ale.

Aspects

- Style is everything
- I follow my instincts

```
Instinctive
Passive ability.
When you get a complication on a skill check
and choose to re-roll, add 3 to the new result.
```

```
Tikh aya
Tikhaya are generous, quiet, and highly value
strength and truth. Some would mistake Tikhaya for
being socially inept, or boring, but the fact is that
Tikhaya are simply uninterested in idle chat, and are
comfortable spending time alone and in
contemplation. There is a sort of strength that
emanates from Tikhaya that has nothing to do with
their physiology—but instead from their self-
certainty and outlook on the ways of the world. Even
Tikhaya children have a sort of natural wisdom about
them that is hardly met by even adults of other
cultures.
Tikhaya can be found across central and northern
Alaria, as well as the Nautili Archipelago, and are
known for their incredible philosophers,
mathematicians, and martial warriors.
```

```
Aspects
```

- I know right from wrong
- Wise in the ways of the world

```
Clear Mind
Passive ability.
You are immune to being confused, frightened,
enraged, or charmed. Additionally, you have A2
when making skill checks or saving throws to see
through deception.
```

```
Neth
Neth are thoughtful and inscrutable, and place a
high emphasis on community, ancestry, and wind. It
is easy to misinterpret a Neth’s silence at a joke as
boredom or even worse, anger, but if you look
```

### KIN & CULTURE

carefully, you may see a glint in their eyes, and they
will soon fire back a joke of their own, all while
never breaking a smile.
Neth are best known for their ability to speak
with the wind, allowing them to communicate with
the deceased members of their communities to gather
advice. The advice and secrets of their ancestors is
central to the longevity and power of the many Neth-
composed tribes that cover the northern tundras. For
this reason, maintaining good relation with one’s
family, and community are critical to Neth culture,
an outlook and behavior that extends to friends they
meet who become close.
Neth can be found across the North Reach, along
the coast, and in the north-eastern regions above
Atyeska, and are famous for their sages, soothsayers,
and resilient warriors.

Aspects

- Inscrutable
- If you look after nature, nature will look after
  you

Speak With the Wind
_Major ability._
While outdoors, when the north wind blows, you
can hear the voices of your ancestors. Once per day,
while not in combat, you may reach out to your
ancestors to ask for their guidance. Choose one:

- Questions and Answers: You may ask them up
  to three questions. They answer to the best of their
  ability. Although they only know what they knew
  during their lifetimes, their knowledge spans
  nearly a millennium.
- Guidance: Define a specific type of task or
  activity. Once, before the end of the day, before
  making a roll for that task or activity, you may
  declare that you are using your ancestors’
  guidance. After rolling, you may replace either die
  with the maximum result of that die.

```
This entire ritual takes 1 minute.
```

```
Oznak
Oznak are proud, brave, and competitive, and
place a high emphasis on proving one’s self-worth
and accruing technical skill with a blade. From a
young age, children are taught with sticks how to
wield a sword, even if they will never be able to
afford a real sword in their lifetime. Most festivals in
Oznak-dominated settlements also include different
types of competitions involving sword play, and
proper tournaments are common in some regions.
While excelling with the blade garners the most
respect, those who don’t become the best are
pressured to succeed and dominate in another field.
This mentality results in a culture of highly
competitive people. Because they value skill so
highly, cheating or cutting corners to get to the top is
seen as despicable, and is a quick path to getting into
a duel with an Oznak.
Oznak can be found across Central North Alaria,
though individuals can be found nearly anywhere in
the world, and are known for their technical
craftsmen, powerful merchants, and terrifying
swordsmen.
```

```
Aspects
```

- I am no coward
- Fiercely competitive

```
Technical Master
Passive ability.
Choose a weapon or tool. If it is a weapon, you
have advantage while wielding it. If it is a tool, you
have A2 on all checks requiring the use of this tool.
```

```
Naga (Dragon Blooded)
Naga make up a long line of humans with dragon
blood running in their veins. Every Naga is a distant
```

descendent of Nagatayora, the almighty dragon-
father and first son of Gaea. When Shara Bolasi died
to Hykravones, Nagatayora flew into a rage and
threw himself at the powerful titan. Such was his
ferocity and intensity, Hykravones was nearly
defeated. But slowly at first, and then methodically,
Hykravones beat Nagatayora back, until finally
grabbing ahold of each end of the colossal dragon
and tearing him in two. As the fiery blood fell, and
heated the lands beneath it, the people below
transformed and became the Naga that still exist
today.
Naga are passionate and determined in all that
they set their minds to, and have an incredibly rich
culture of art, religious tradition, and philosophy.
They also have a profound sense of pride, both for
themselves, their culture, and the things they care
about. If they feel that any of those things have been
wronged, then they will not back down until amends
have been made. Their fury is a terrible force to
behold.

Aspects

- Iron determination
- Boiling vengeance

Aspect of the Dragon

_Major ability._
You may channel your blood of Naga, and
transform into a dragon-like form. Your head morphs
into the head of a dragon and your scales surface in
patches over your skin. While in this form, you gain
the following traits:

- You take half damage from fire.
- You gain +1 to defense rolls from your natural,
  scaly armor.
- You may belch fire, dealing 2d6 damage in a
  10-foot cone. You may only use this ability once
  per transformation.
- Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you
  gain one level of enraged towards that creature. If
  another creature deals damage to you, remove all
  other levels of enraged gained from this ability.
- You have advantage on skill checks to
  intimidate others.
  You remain in this form until you spend your
  action to return to your human form.

```
Ulvsjael (Wolf C h i ldr e n)
The ulvsjael are human descendants of Ulvma,
the wolf mother and the second child of the Gaea.
When Shara Bolasi died in his duel against
Hykravones, Nagatayora had descended into
madness, Ulvma stayed back with the armies of
Alaria and fought till the very end before being cut
down and collapsing into the ground amongst the
armies. When humans came and drank from her
blood, the Ulvsjael were born.
The Ulvsjael are a pragmatic and fiercely loyal
race who believe in the natural order of life. Much of
life revolves around small, nomadic units which
travel as a pack. They will protect their comrades
with their own lives, but they also feel no qualms
about keeping those who cannot defend themselves
alive. If you cannot contribute, you are culled. This
harsh outlook is even more brutal towards outsiders,
who are usually seen as dead weight until they have
proven their worthiness to their pack. However,
when the Ulvsjael themselves is the outsider—a rare
appearance, due to their tendency to stick with their
kind—they are frequently the hardest working, such
is their desire to prove their usefulness to a new
community.
Ulvsjael can be found across Alaria, and are
known for their formidable mercenary groups,
trackers, and explorers.
```

### KIN & CULTURE

Aspects

- Loyal to a fault
- Only the strong can survive

Aspect of the Wolf
_Major ability._
You may channel your blood of Ulvsjael, and
transform into a wolf-like form. Your head morphs
into the head of a wolf and claws grow on your
hands. While in this form, you gain the following
traits:

- You gain A2 on all skill checks for perceiving
  things that can be smelt or heard.
- Your move speed increases by 40 feet.
- Your jaws and claws count as light piercing
  and slashing melee weapons, respectively.
- Whenever you are in an engagement, choose a
  valid target for your stance. All creatures have
  advantage on attack rolls against that creature.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or
  manipulate fine objects.
  You remain in this form until you spend your
  action to return to your human form.

Sharabha (Li o n H e a r t s)

Sharabha are the children of Shara Bolasi, the
great lion father and third child of Gaea. When
Hykravones first arrived on Alaria, Shara Bolasi was
the first to step forward, alone, to make a stand
against the powerful titan. In the terrible ensuing
battle, Shara Bolasi was slowly beaten down, before
at last, Hykravones stepped forward and ripped
Shara Bolasi’s heart out through his chest, before
stomping it beneath his foot. Millenia later, when
people had settled across Alaria once more, the
humans who ate from the soil there became the first
Sharabha.
Sharabha are known for their warmth,
compassion, and incredible honor. In Sharabha

```
communities, a lying Sharabha is an exiled
Sharabha. The leaders of Sharabha prides, as they are
sometimes called, are usually the strongest, most
respected member of a pride. They will make
unilateral decisions for the pride until a new leader is
chosen.
Outside these communities, Sharabha who have
willingly left do not practice many of their more
traditional rituals, but maintain their fierce sense of
principles and morality.
```

```
Aspects
```

- My honor before my life
- Better die brave than live a coward

```
Aspect of the Lion
Major ability.
You may channel your blood of Shara Bolasi,
and transform into a lion-like form. Your head
morphs into the head of a lion and claws grow on
your hands. While in this form, you gain the
following traits:
```

- Your jaws count as a heavy piercing weapon.
  Your claws count as light slashing weapons.
- Whenever you deal damage with your jaws to
  an enemy, you may choose to not let go. If you do,
  and if the creature is no more than one size larger
  than you, the creature takes a level of restrained
  until it spends its action and wins a might check
  against your might challenge number. While
  holding on, you cannot attack with your jaws
  again. Both you and the bitten creature have your
  move speeds reduced by half, and move together.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or
  manipulate fine objects.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.
  You remain in this form until you spend your
  action to return to your human form.

Elf

Elves are a race of fiercely independent, ancient,
culturally rich people. With lifespans five times the
length of a humans’, elves have a much broader
perspective on life and the world around them, and a
lot more time to explore and refine their passions.
Wars, politics, and the frivolities of other races are
far less important to most elven cultures.

Vitals

- Size: Medium
- Height: 5-6.5 feet
- Weight: 100-180 pounds

Years of Experience

_Passive ability._
Gaining additional or upgrading your aspects
costs 2 less XP, for a minimum of 1, and your
maximum rank for each of your aspects is increased
by 3.

Amverela (High Elf)

The Amverela are the most prolific and long-
living of the elves, and most interactive with the
other inhabitants of Alaria. Partially due to their long
life times, but especially due to their extreme
wisdom, passion, and expertise, the Amverela are
some of the longest running ethnic identities among
all people on Alaria—having survived numerous
cataclysmic events, wars, and famines while
remaining relatively culturally intact.
They place a higher value on investing in
themselves, their relationships, and their
communities. This has led them to building some of
the most magnificent cities in Alaria—utopian, by
most standards.

```
The Amverela can be found across Alaria, and
are known for their extraordinary skill in all aspects
of life.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Centuries of wisdom
- Cautious

```
Expertise
Passive ability.
Choose one:
```

- The XP cost of gaining martial talents and their
  destiny levels decreases by 2.
- The XP cost of gaining cognitive talents and
  their destiny levels decreases by 2.

```
Caerene (Wood Elf)
The Caerene have darker, more olive skin than
their Zaelian and Amverela cousins, allowing them
to more easily blend into the forests in which they
usually live.
Caerene are far more isolating than many other
races, preferring to remain unbothered by the trivial,
day-to-day grievances and turmoil of most life on
Alaria. For that reason, most populations have found
hard to reach or find locations as well as methods of
hiding and blending in with their natural
surroundings. An unobservant individual walking
through the middle of a Caerene village may not
even be aware anyone is around—so skillful are the
Caerene.
Most Caerene culture emphasizes finding
balance in nature, and preserving that balance. They
place a lot of significance on fate, fairness, and
immediate justice. There are no second chances in
Caerene culture.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Perceptive and stealthy

### KIN & CULTURE

- Nature is my home

War de n of t h e W i l ds
_Passive ability._
You may ignore non-magical difficult terrain,
your move speed is increased by 20 when not
wearing heavy armor, and you have A2 on all skill
checks relating to nature, survival, and stealth in the
outdoors.

Dwarf

Dwarves are a short but hearty people, and are
generally more pragmatic than the other races. While
some live underground, many more do not.

Vitals

- Size: Medium
- Height: 3.5-5 feet
- Weight: 100-180 pounds

Heart y and Gruff
_Passive ability._
It costs 1 less XP when you choose to spend XP
to increase your maximum hit points.
Additionally, when wielding a shield or heavy
weapon, you get +1 on your A/D rolls.
You are also immune to the frightened condition.

Drasnian (Stout Dwarf)

Drasnian dwarves are the eldest and by far most
populous of the dwarven heritages, dating back to
before the Uline dwarves went underground.
Drasnians are generally a stout, serious bunch, with
softer features than their other dwarven cousins, and
live almost exclusively above ground or in homes
built into hillsides. They have a long history of both
prosperity and destitution, and through economic
trade, fleeing war and persecution, and enslavement,
have made it all over Alaria. Drasnians can be found
in vast numbers at nearly any cultural hub, as well as
in several countries where Drasnians have settled
down in large numbers, including Drasnia itself, the
believed birthplace of the Drasnians.
As a whole, they value education, money, and
preserving their cultural and religious legacy.
Drasnian culture is rich with customs dictating
worship, relationships, and one’s day-to-day life.

```
Aspects
```

- Good with money and numbers
- I will do my duty

```
Alert
Passive ability.
You have advantage on all cunning checks to
determine if someone has bad intentions, and may
choose to have first priority in combat.
In addition, you gain the perceptive talent as a
racial ability (it does not count towards the number
of talents you have).
```

```
Uline (Chain Dwarf)
The Uline originated from a particularly
productive iron mine, many thousands of years ago.
The mine, which had struck a rich vein of ore was so
vast and deep that it would inevitably take more than
a generation to complete. Rather than journey to and
from the surface daily, they discovered that it was
more efficient to temporarily station some dwarves
within the mines for days, or even weeks at a time.
With time, these temporary stations became more
permanent residencies, and eventually, entire
settlements. These dwarves became the Uline—
named after the settlement that grew up in that first
mine. Today, the Uline are the most industrious of
the dwarves, preferring to live underground, mining,
and making their homes in the mountains beneath
the surface.
Living underground came with several
unexpected effects, that the Uline now embrace or
have adapted to. Beneath the surface, there are few
people who can interfere with a settlement’s growth.
Defense from invaders is easier when underground,
which has allowed the Uline to allocate more
resources towards magnificent palaces, inventions,
and other intellectual efforts. Additionally, within a
single generation, the number of earth attuned
```

### KIN & CULTURE

individuals increased drastically, enhancing the
population’s ability to mine and control their
environment underground.
However, underground life also came with
several hardships. Fish, fungi, and insects are nearly
the only things alive besides the monsters from the
deep, and little airflow and high temperatures deep
underground require complex air circulation systems
in place. The Uline have gotten around this latter
problem by implementing networks of air vents
leading to the surface, manipulated through long
chains, giving them their nickname of chain
dwarves.
Even more difficult to deal with were the
shadereavers and other monstrosities from the dark.
While the Aureum dwarves invented huge mirrored
passageways into the depths of the caves, using the
sun’s light to protect themselves from the creatures
of the dark, the Uline resorted to iron. To this day,
children are taught from a young age how to wield
the heavy iron blades and hammers used to defend
themselves from the monsters of the dark.
Living underground has shaped the Uline into a
rough, tough, and pragmatic group, but they are
usually goodnatured, and even sometimes downright
jolly. However, it is unwise to get into an argument
with most Uline; the Uline have done things in the
same way for thousands of years, and change is not
something many of them are welcome to. When
disagreement does arise, arbitrage usually falls on
higher ranking individuals within the community,
who will have final say.

Aspects

- Stubborn to a fault
- I respect true authority

```
Mountain-Born
Passive ability
You gain your choice of a basic attunement to
earth or darkness.
```

```
Au r e u m (Su n Dwarf)
In the early days of the Uline, when no more than
a few underground settlements existed, an upwelling
of shadereavers from deep below nearly wiped out
the underground population. Immediately, multiple
factions emerged proposing different ways to avoid
such catastrophes in the future. One of these such
factions determined that nothing but the light of the
sun could shield them from such monstrosities, and
swore to find a way to brings the sun’s light into the
depths of the Uline caves. While many of the Uline
thought this was impossible, and rejected the idea,
some latched on, and the Aureum were born.
The Aureum use complex systems of mirrors and
glass to illuminate their underground settlements
with the warm glow of sunlight. Within a few more
centuries, they had also discovered the secret to
storing liquid sunlight, keeping them safe even when
night came. Now, this liquid sunlight is smelted into
much of their armor and weapons, and keeps them
strong, and as they now believe, pure.
Aureum culture emphasizes law, honor, and
truth. When the Aureum first broke away from the
Uline, their leader, Aurea herself, promised to keep
her people safe, so long as her followers trusted her,
and followed her commands. They did, and she
carried through—permanently cementing the
importance of a promise and following one’s leader.
```

```
Aspects
```

- The law comes first
- My word is my bond

Su nsmith
_Major ability._
As an Aureum, you are privy to the secret
methods of extracting liquid sunlight from the sun’s
rays, and you always have a flask of sunlight
available. It emits light out to 10 feet, and dim light
for 10 feet beyond that. You may use this flask for
any one of the following abilities:

- Health and Rejuvenation. As an interact action,
  you may drink the flask and gain the benefits of a
  short rest.
- Smash. As an interact action, you may crush or
  throw your flask to cast _Blinding Sun_.
  Once you have used your flask, you cannot do so
  again until you spend 10 minutes in private at sunrise
  or sunset to capture the sun’s rays. The sunlight
  within a flask expires after 12 hours.

### KIN & CULTURE

Gnome

Gnomes are small, naturally magical creatures,
resembling miniature humans. They range in height
from two to three feet, and are frequently quite
slender and nimble. Gnomish adventurers are
generally more magically adept than hearty, and will
often have entire sleeves of handmagic tattoos
stretching up their arms.

Vitals

- Size: Small
- Height: 2.5-3.5 feet
- Weight: 40-100 pounds

Gnomish Blood

_Passing ability._
Handmagic talents and their destiny levels cost 2
less XP, and increasing your maximum hit point
costs 1 more XP. Your size is small.

Goshwen (Hill Gnome)

If there is one thing that can be said abut
Goshwen gnomes, it is that they are clever. Not
intelligent, nor wise—few are scholars, and they get
into trouble all the time—but they are definitely
clever. Inventors, tricksters, comedians, thieves,
merchants—these are the professions Goshwen are
known for. Goshwen are a good natured, frequently
witty people, who have lived on Alaria for eons.
While countries go to war, the Goswhen are content
to lace their cities with illusions and abstain from
battle. There are no Goshwen empires, nor Goshwen
wars, or invasions. Goshwen are elusive, and
competent.
Goshwen’s culture of openness and constant
change has resulted in numerous fragmentations of
their communities. This has given rise to many

```
different branches of Goshwen communities across
Alaria with different quirks and identities. However,
all of them maintain their appreciation for progress
and wit.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Creative
- Let’s just see what happens!

```
Clever
Passive ability.
You gain the talent as a racial ability (it does not
count towards the number of talents you have), along
with it’s destiny level.
```

```
Ezuri (Tr e e G n om e)
The Ezuri, or “tree people” as it translates to
from Old Gnomish, stemmed from when Mad
Gorehorn disease ravaged what is now known as the
Jungles of Titania, transforming many of the forest
dwelling creatures into rabid, flesh eating monsters.
While many fled the jungle, some were trapped, and
forced up and into the trees. By the time the disease
had passed, the gnomes were comfortable in their
new living situation. Nowadays, the Ezuri live across
Alaria, usually living in interconnected houses built
among the trees, or if not, in other closely knit, lofty
places.
The Ezuri also value connection with each other
as well as the natural world around them, and are
taught the secrets of speaking with animals from a
young age. This, combined with their natural affinity
for magic, allow them to stand up to the much larger
humanoids across Alaria.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Insightful
- Compassionate

Speaker for the Small
_Passive ability._
You gain the _Nature’s Child_ talent as a racial
ability (it does not count towards the number of
talents you have), along with its destiny level.

### KIN & CULTURE

Goblin

Goblins are born in broods, from a single father
and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father
may sire thousands of goblin children, who are all
raised together, with no knowledge of their specific
mother. The brood-father, over the course of his
lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen,
who will mother the next brood-father—the first
born son.
Most goblins live in communities around a single
goblin lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and
friends are one’s half-siblings. This can lead to
bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict.
Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie
that many goblins feel towards their brood-mates.

Vitals

- Size: Small
- Height: 2.5-3.5 feet
- Weight: 40-100 pounds

Cooperative

_Passive ability._
Whenever you help someone on a skill check, or
take the help action in combat, you provide two
levels of advantage rather than one, and they may
add half of any single relevant aspect you have. You
do not need to spend DP. If that creature is a goblin,
they gain three levels of advantage instead.

Scal awag

Scalawag goblins are aptly named for their
mischievous, sneaky, and up-to-no-good nature.
They are viewed more as pests than as people by
many of the intelligent beings of Alaria, and from a
scientific perspective, their behaviors is somewhat
similar to that of ants. However; living among

```
Scalawag society shows a vivid, colorful culture of
merriment, passion, and duty. Most Scalawag are
born into enormous broods, and are expected to
defend their lineage of goblins. These goblins will
spend most of their lives doing just that, along with
anything else they feel like doing. Besides the
general wellbeing of the community, though,
scalawags have few other obligations, and will
sometimes devote horrifying amounts of time to the
most absurd activities for fun or curiosity.
Scalawag can be found across the mountains and
scattered throughout most cultural hubs, and are
known for their incredible performers, parties, and
oddly enough, philosophers.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Emotionally turbulent
- Impulsive and improvisational

```
Ankle Biter
Passive ability.
Rules for moving through and climbing on
creatures larger than yourself apply even if the
creature is only one size larger than you. You have
advantage on all checks made to climb onto and hold
onto those creatures. In addition, larger creatures do
not count as difficult terrain, and occupying the same
space as a hostile creatures provides one level of
cover from attacks from all other creatures.
```

```
Etherweaver
Etherweavers get their name for their longtime
mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark,
force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver
bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and
every goblin is born with an attunement to one of
those elements.
Etherweavers are generally more reserved and
cautious than their Scalawag cousins. They value

Uncommon Activities

preparation, and are usually more conscientious,
even if not knowledgable, of the world beyond the
brood. Etherweavers are also usually adept at
protecting their broods using magic, and therefore
require fewer goblins to protect, meaning that
etherweaver communities are much smaller, ranging
in the 10s to 100s. The smaller numbers leads to a
greater sense of individuality among the
etherweavers, and means that serving the brood is
less of a duty and more of a commitment to family.
The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go
on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural
affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a
leg up over others, though etherweavers can be
found in nearly any other profession as well—having
elemental attunements can always come in handy.

```
Aspects
```

- Level-headed
- Reflective and thoughtful

Etherweaver

_Passive ability._
Choose and gain two attunements from the
following list.

- Time
- Void
- Force
- Light
- Dark

### KIN & CULTURE

Minotaur

Minotaur are mighty, formidable creatures,
known for their powerful builds and no-nonsense
nature. Although most grow up in minotaur-
dominated communities, they have spread out across
Alaria, and can be found in great numbers in many
large armies.

Vitals

- Size: Medium
- Height: 6-7.5 feet
- Weight: 200-350 pounds

Minotaur Horns
_Passive ability._

The horns on your head count as a heavy
piercing melee weapon so long as you move at least
15 feet in a straight-line towards an enemy before
immediately attacking. You get one level of
advantage on your attacks made with your horns for
every 15 feet you charged before you attack. This
stacks up three times.

Danaki

Danaki are infamous for their toughness and their
terrifying rage. Danaki have no sense of family, as
the baby minotaur children are raised by the village.
Most do not know who their parents are, nor are they
interested in finding out. From a young age, they are
taught to fight and kill, usually long before they
learn how to read and write.
Danaki are also known for their rage—a berserk
state of anger and pure, single-minded aggression.
During a rage, they can behave unpredictably and
incredibly violently, and are capable of ignoring
many injuries.

```
Danaki are trained from a young age to express
very little emotion, and suppress it if possible.
Affection, joy, pain, and sadness are all viewed as
signs of weakness, and most claim that they have not
felt those things since they were a child. Marriages
in Danaki villages are arranged by the village
council once each member in the union has been
deemed “stable”. Most Danaki view their marriage
as a rite of passage to adulthood, a way of showing
that you have completed your growth. The marriages
are generally for convenience and pleasure, as many
aspects of emotion and family have been rooted out.
Although the Danaki inevitably grow attached to
one another, they admit it only in confidence, and
believe themselves capable of making decisions
completely unaffected by that attachment.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Show no weakness
- Obstinately bullheaded

```
Berserk
Major ability. Instant.
It is said that the Danaki rage is the physical
release of all the pent up emotions held within them.
Whether this is true is up to you.
Whenever you take damage, you may enter a
berserk state. While berserk, your movement speed
increases by 20, and increase every instance of
incoming and outgoing physical damage by 2. You
remain berserk so long as you make an A/D roll or
enter an engagement each round, up to a minute.
```

```
Lorean Minotaur
While Danaki may be a fast hire for a mercenary
crew, Lorean are more likely to be found as the
commanding general for a king’s army. In describing
the difference between Lorean and Danaki, it is most
famously quoted that “Lorean think with their head,
```

not with their horns”. Of course, if you ask their
spouses, they will say that they “think with their
head, not with their hearts”. This is the cursed
blessing of Lorean—incredibly tactically minded,
but seemingly incapable of thinking about problems
in any other way.
Lorean culture places a heavy emphasis on
education and sound decision making. To make a
mistake because emotions clouded one’s judgement
is worthy of profound shame. It’s not that Lorean
don't experience emotions—they do—but to let them
influence one’s decision at all is weakness and
failure, especially when other people’s wellbeing is
at stake.
This sense of duty towards protection lies as
deeply, if not more so, as their aversion towards
emotional decision-making. A Lorean who has been
placed in charge of his troop will die before letting
his troop get hurt. To fail in this would be the
ultimate failure as a minotaur—worthy of self-exile.
Although Lorean would never hold anyone else to
such high standards, including other minotaur, every
Lorean would never give such leniency to
themselves.

Aspects

- Profoundly caring
- Emotions get in the way of logical thinking

Tac t i c a l S u p r e m ac y
_Passive ability._
You may take an additional help action each
round. When you take the help action, you may
instead choose a willing creature within 30 feet and
move it 5 feet in any direction. This movement does
not provoke opportunity attacks.

### KIN & CULTURE

Tr ol l k i n

Half-breeds and outcasts—trollkin are the
unwanted children of humans and trolls. Rare is the
troll and human couple, and rarer still is the trollkin
child that makes it past the first few months in the
world. If not surreptitiously smothered or abandoned
in a forest, most trollkin end up in orphanages, where
they grow up as outsiders amongst their peers. In
troll communities, they are viewed as weak and
fragile, and in human communities, they are viewed
as too stupid and emotionless to be effective
members of society.
Unfortunately for trollkin, they are perfectly
capable of understanding and figuring out many
things, but are terrible at expressing it. Some trollkin
abandon society to live alone in nature, becoming
hermits and befriending the animals around them,
who they may feel more comfortable around.
Others choose to become experts in a niche field
of academics, where they do not need to interact
with many people, but can still let their creative,
roaming minds explore. Many of the greatest
discoveries were made by trollkin, though credit may
never be given to their name.
Still others turn to more violent areas of life.
When faced with the constant frustration of trying to
get others to understand you, some eventually
consider violence. Due to their troll blood and hide,
trollkin are formidable agents in combat.

Aspects

- Thick-headed
- Contemplating what no one else is

Vitals

- Size: Large
- Height: 7.5-8.5 feet
- Weight: 200-400 pounds

```
Tr ol l B l o od
Passive ability.
At the beginning of each round, if you are
conscious, regain 2 hit points, up to the maximum
determined by your current heart die.
```

```
Massive Build
Passive ability.
The XP cost of increasing your maximum hit
points is reduced by 2. Your size is large.
```

Revenant

Once you were dead, but now—well, you still
are, kind of. Revenants are semi corporeal versions
of their past, living, selves. When a creature dies and
rather than leaving its physical form, chooses to
remain within, it forfeits its ability to ever leave and
is eternally trapped in the material world where they
remain as a revenant. There are many reasons
revenants may choose to stay, but the most common
involve unfinished business. Whether it’s getting
revenge, or fighting for a cause they believe in, this
goal is a top priority. While revenants may take
detours along the way, they will always come back to
their purpose for remaining in the material world.
By remaining in the material world, revenants
forfeit their rights to an afterlife. Once a revenant has
completed whatever business kept them in this
world, they generally slowly go crazy and are
eventually hunted down and killed by children of
Anubis or other specialized killers.
Due to revenant’s near immortality, they are
forced to watch as everyone they love inevitably
grows old and dies, which contributes to the slow
decaying of their sanity.

Aspects

- Unfinished business
- [Choose one from your previous race]

Vitals

You have whatever vitals you would have had
before you died.

Undead
_Passive ability._

You no longer need to eat, drink, or breathe, and
cannot be poisoned.

```
You have already died, and can therefore not die
again in the traditional sense. When you would
normally die, you instead fall unconscious for 24
hours and are reborn where you died the first time
with no memory of your life after death.
You take double damage from silvered weapons,
and if you should die to a silver weapon, you are
dead forever.
Also, your physical body is no longer fully alive,
and it will slowly decay with passing time. Though
you can generally maintain your appearance from
your moment of death, your skin no longer closes up
over wounds, so your body will begin to fall apart.
For this reason, many revenants prefer to cover up as
much of their skin as possible, and to travel
unnoticed. Once you have died in a corpse three
times, it is too mangled to ever return to.
```

```
Detached Spirit
Passive ability.
You have a soul, shadow, and spirit—all
necessary for true life, but they are no longer bound
to your corporal body in the same way—instead, it is
through willpower alone that you keep them attached
to your physical form. This is a constant struggle,
and when you waver, your form flickers as your
spirit sloughs away from your skin. This, however,
comes with benefits.
As an action, you may let your concentration fall,
causing you to dissolve into a pool of light and
shadow. While in this form, you gain the following
effects:
```

- You can fit through any space larger than the
  width of a pebble.
- You cannot interact with the physical world
- You take half damage from all non-silver, non-
  iron sources, rounded down.
- You cannot take actions.
- You cannot speak.

### KIN & CULTURE

- Your physical body remains collapsed
  wherever you left it. You may return to it, or any
  other unoccupied corpse.

Deva

Deva are rare, beautiful, creatures with very
commanding presences that enter the world fully
grown, intelligent, with no family, and a single,
driving purpose. Several explanation exist on how
they appear, though the most supported reasoning is
that they are manifestations of collective thought and
hope from the Psyic plane.
Deva generally have light, gray, blueish,
lavender, or red skin, and lack any pupils in their
eyes, which are pure white. They are on average,
slightly taller than humans, though only slightly.
Deva rarely appear looking younger than in their
twenties, and rarely older than their fifties, although
it does occasionally happen. They are quite rare, and
in combination with their striking features, they are
generally at the center of attention of any room they
enter.
Deva are always “born” with a deep feeling of
hope and purpose. The source of that hope and
purpose is never clear, but the force with which these
drive a Deva on usually results in them pursuing that
goal for the rest of their lives. These purposes are
usually somewhat noble, such as “freeing the region
from tyrannical control by a cruel aristocrat” or
“leading their community safely to a new land”.
These purposes tend to align with the communities
in which they spawn, supporting theories of their
psyic origins.
Deva also are born with a feeling of having
memories that are not entirely their own. They do not
know how they know so many skills, as they
remember nothing of learning them. They may have
faint memories of past events within their
communities, or even past experiences of other deva
before them, but beyond that, it feels as though their
lives began when they spawned.

```
When a deva dies, their body dissipates—there is
no body left over. If they failed at their purpose,
another deva may appear years later, or if they
succeeded, another deva might not appear for
hundreds of years.
```

```
Aspects
```

- Core purpose: Choose one for your community
- Hope

```
Vitals
```

- Size: Medium
- Height: 5.5-6.5 feet
- Weight: 140-240 pounds

```
Naturally Charismatic
Passive ability.
Increasing your presence die costs 2 less XP. You
do not need to reach PL2 in order to take the
Draconic Presence paragon level.
```

```
Memories Passed
Major ability. Instant.
The psyic energy from which you spawned
occasionally provides imagery from others’
memories of the past as well, guiding you when you
face difficult challenges. You may use this ability to
gain advantage on any skill check you make. If the
skill check also aligns with your deeper purpose, you
instead gain A3.
You also do not have a soul or shadow, and are
thus invisible on both the ethereal and nethereal
planes. This also excludes you from effects on
creatures with souls or shadows.
```

### KIN & CULTURE

Ghoul

Ghouls are the descendants of servants spawned
by ancient, powerful wizards. They were created as
butlers, maids, and test subjects, fabricated from the
combination of Deoric ritual and a body of the
recently deceased, made to serve the wizards.
Because of this, ghouls lack any spirit, making them
immune to some effects, but incredibly susceptible to
Kethic elemental magic. They exert no Kethic
presence, meaning there’s nothing stopping a water
attuned mage from filling a ghoul’s lungs with water,
or a fire attuned mage from igniting the very skin of
a ghoul.
After the age of great Deoric mages ended,
ghouls lived on. They are rare, and not infrequently
killed for their distinctive, gaunt, gray skin that
identifies them as ghouls, an aspect that many try to
cover up. This widely felt vehemence towards ghouls
stems from the belief that they kill other humanoids
and eat them—which is partially true.
Due to the nature of ghouls’ origin, they feel an
eternal emptiness within their bodies that aches to be
filled. Eating magic, and the souls of other living
things sate that hunger. While eating magic and flesh
are not strictly necessary for ghoul survival, it
usually feels that way, and any chance to eat magic
or the recently deceased has a powerful frenzying
effect on all ghouls. Many give in to this urge,
feeling little sympathy towards a world that has
given them nothing but hurt, creating a reputation for
all ghouls of hunting and eating humans. Seeing a
ghoul in a feeding frenzy is a truly horrifying
experience—one that only needs to be seen once
before never wanting to be near another ghoul again.
For these reasons, ghoul hunters can be found
across Alaria. Nearly all are mages—capable of
killing a ghoul in nearly an instant. While some
ghouls try to flee or hide from the hunters, others

```
fight back, usually gathering in small groups in the
hopes of overwhelming the hunter.
Despite not being able to create biological
offspring, some ghouls will create other ghouls,
using the same cruel magic as was used to create the
original few. The Deoric ritual is innately known by
all ghouls, and requires nothing more than one dead
body, and one live one for sacrifice. This ritual takes
1 hour to perform.
```

```
Aspects
```

- I must eat flesh
- Terrifying presence

```
Vitals
You have whatever vitals you gained from the
body you were reanimated from.
```

```
Soul Eater
Passive ability.
When you are adjacent to a humanoid or creature
of greater power that has died within the last hour,
you may spend an action to suck its soul out and
ingest it. Doing so lets you heal, learn something
about the creature, gain temporary magical power, or
temporarily store its soul in your body to protect you
from elemental magic.
When you ingest a creature’s soul, choose one
from the following list.
```

- Replenish. Regain 5 hp and any conditions
  affecting you.
- Inspect. The GM must tell you one secret about
  this creature’s past life.
- Devour. If the creature had an ability die higher
  than your own, you may replace your ability die
  with their ability die for the next ten minutes.
- Infuse. For the next 1d10 days, spelltouched
  cannot use their action to inflict wounds upon you,
  as detailed in the _Deoric Origins_ ability described
  below.

While flesh is a preferred substitute for standard
food, you can still consume normal foodstuffs for
nutrients.

Deoric Origins
_Passive ability._

Gaining oath talents and their destiny levels cost
2 XP less.
As an action, someone with a basic attunement
may inflict 10 damage on you, so long as you are
within 45 feet. If they have an advanced attunement,
they inflict 20 damage instead, and the range
increases to 90 feet. With a paragon level
attunement, they may inflict 30 damage, and the
range increases to 120 feet. The _Infuse_ option from
your _Soul Eater_ can prevent creatures with elemental
attunement from doing this.

### KIN & CULTURE

Savant

Savants, for reasons unknown, are born with rare
differences in their physiology, sometimes
sacrificing the ability to move, sense, or
communicate effectively in exchange for excelling
greatly in other ways. They can be born into nearly
any race, from anyone. In some communities,
savants are worshipped as supernatural beings, while
in others they are shunned and treated as outcasts.

Aspects

Choose one aspect from the following list, and
one from the heritage or race from your _Savant
Birthright_.

- Paranoid
- Emotionally cold
- Obsessed
- Vicious

Vitals

```
You have the same vitals as the original creature.
```

Savant Birthright

_Passive ability._
When you choose this race, you must also choose
a heritage from a different race. You are technically
of that race, and gain all of the associated aspects.
However, you will replace the abilities granted from
the race—not the heritage—with your choice of
abilities listed later in this section. For example, if
you chose Uline dwarf, you would keep the
Mountain-born ability, but lose the Hearty and Gruff
ability.
Upon picking a heritage, choose one ability from
the Physical & Mental Abilities section listed below,
and gain its tier 1 ability.
Then, if you wish, you may choose and gain one
of the conditions from the Physical and Mental

```
Conditions section listed below. If you do, you gain
the tier 2 ability for whichever talent you chose in
the earlier step, or a different tier 1 ability.
```

```
Physical & Mental Conditions
You may choose one passive ability from the
options listed below. If you do, you may gain a
second tier 1 ability, or the tier 2 ability of your
initial chosen ability.
```

```
Blind
Passive ability.
You are completely blind, and therefore cannot
see. You permanently have three levels of blindness.
```

```
Physically Disabled
Passive ability.
You use crutches or another device to aid your
mobility. Your movement speed is reduced by 40
feet.
```

```
Deaf and Mute
Passive ability.
You are deaf and mute. You cannot understand
anything more than simple ideas when people talk to
you, and you cannot talk back.
```

```
Physical & Mental Abilities
Choose an ability from this section and gain its
tier 1 ability. You can gain the tier 2 ability, or
choose a second tier 1 ability if you also take a
condition from the Physical and Mental Conditions
list above.
```

```
Te le pat h
Passive ability.
Tier 1: You can communicate telepathically with
any humanoid (or equally sentient creature) you
touch. While you are touching them, they can
communicate telepathically with you as well. You
```

may also sense using their senses, during which you
cannot sense through your own. Creatures are not
aware that you are sensing through them.
Tier 2: Your tier 1 abilities are not limited by
touch, and instead extend to a range of 20 feet.

Tr e m or s e n s e

_Passive ability._
Tier 1: By sensing vibrations in ground and air,
you can sense the location and shape of anything
within 20 feet of you, including through walls. This
counts as being able to see that object for the sake of
abilities that rely on sight. You cannot see color, and
details are limited to only things larger than your fist.
For example, you cannot read using this ability.
Tier 2: The range of this ability extends to 60
feet.

Futuresight

_Passive ability._
Tier 1: You have the Sight, and can see glimpses
into the future. Whenever you fall asleep or are
unconscious, you have a vision. Before you wake up,
you may ask the GM a question about an event in the
future. The GM must give a vague answer (generally
no more than a couple words), to the best of their
ability.
Tier 2: Your futuresight is more developed. Once,
at the beginning of each day, roll three dice of any
size you wish. Whenever you, the GM, or anyone
else rolls a die with size matching one of the dice
you rolled, you may replace the result with the result
from your die roll. After doing so, you cannot use
that die again.

## Advanced Character Creation

WARNING: This section is still work in
progress.
For added depth to character creation and
progression, there are several other steps to character
creation. Everyone in the group should decide
together if they would like to use these optional
rules.

Skills

Skills represent talent in a specific area. When
you create a character, you start with no skills.
However, as you spend downtime practicing new
things and overcoming difficult tasks, you begin to
learn, slowly and automatically increasing your rank
in the relevant skills.
Like aspects, specializations are just a title and a
rank that grants bonuses to related skill checks.
When you create your character, you start with
no skills.
Gaining ranks in a skill happens via training and
overcoming challenges during gameplay. To gain a
rank in any skill, consult the following table.

```
The columns after the column for rank represent
the requirements for gaining that rank in a skill.
```

```
Downtime Weeks
In order to get the rank in a skill, you must spend
at least that many weeks of downtime devoted to
studying, training, and practicing that skill.
Additional weeks do not count towards future ranks.
```

```
Challenges
In addition to downtime spent practicing, you
need to succeed at a certain number of challenges to
achieve the next rank. A challenge is anything that
meets the following criteria:
```

- It must be a skill check using your
  specialization.
- The CN for the roll is at least the maximum of
  your heart die + your rank in the skill.
- There are narrative stakes to failing the roll.
  If all criteria are met, and the skill check is
  successful, you may mark down a challenge
  completed. Here are some examples of some skills
  and some corresponding challenges.
- Pickpocketing: Pickpocket a very wealthy
  merchant who’s actively looking for pickpockets.
- Hunting: Shoot a rampaging bull in the streets
  before the it hurts someone.
- Chariot Racing: Beat a fellow chariot driver in
  a race.

```

```

```
Challenges Missions
```

Completing extra challenges does not count
towards future ranks.

Missions

Missions demonstrate an even greater mastery of
a particular skill. Like challenges, there are certain
criteria for a mission.

- It must represent deeper learning, mastery, or
  understanding of the skill, requiring its application
  multiple times, or a few times in critical
  circumstances. This should scale up as the rank in
  your skill increases.
- Success is uncertain, and cannot be
  automatically achieved with a single, high roll.
- There are narrative stakes to failing the roll.
  If all criteria are met and you succeed at what
  you set out to do, you may mark down the mission
  completed. Here are some examples of some skills
  and some corresponding missions.
- Playing the Lute: Perform at a prestigious
  venue with positive audience reaction.
- Painting: Get a painting commissioned for
  nobility and impress them.
- Jousting: Win the jousting tournament
  Completing extra missions does not count
  towards future ranks. However, one mission can
  satisfy the requirements for multiple skills so long as
  those skills clearly apply.

Skill & Background Overlap

If you would like to start learning a skill that you
would have picked up from your background, you
may request to start your rank in that skill at the rank
of the background. The GM has final say.

Using a Skill

Whenever you make a skill check that would
reasonably use a skill you have a rank in, you may
add your rank in the skill to the roll. If you have a

```
background that also applies, you must choose to
either use the bonus from the background or the
bonus from the skill.
If a skill only “sort of” applies, you may apply
half of your bonus, rounded down.
```

Age

When you create your character, choose an age:
young, adult, or elderly. Each age comes with
distinct benefits and drawbacks.

You n g

If you are young, you get the following
adjustments.

- You start with only two ranks worth of
  backgrounds, rather than four.
- You start with no influence.
- Add 20 to all of your sleeping checks.
- At the start of each round, you gain 1 hit point.

Adult

If you are an adult, you get the following
adjustments.

- You start with four ranks worth of
  backgrounds.
- You start with influence 1.
- Choose a life path from the Life Path section.

Elderly

If you are elderly, you get the following
adjustments.

- You start with six ranks worth of backgrounds,
  rather than four. No background can have more
  than 5 points in it.
- You start with influence 2.
- Choose a life path from the Life Path section.
- Your move speed is reduced by 30 feet.
- Your maximum hit points start at 30. It costs 1
  additional XP to increase them.

Li f e P a t h

If you are an adult or elderly, you may choose a
life path. Gain the benefits from the chosen life path.

Family Connections
You were born into a family with influence and
importance.
Treasured Possession
You have a family heirloom, or by some means
have come into possession of an important relic.
Why is it important to you? Is it magical? Is there
more potential to unlock? Why do you have it
instead of someone else?

portion of your life. Are they still around? Are they
still alive? Why were they important? What was the

Do you uphold their values, or rebel against them?
What responsibilities and expectations come with
your lineage? How do others perceive your noble
status?
Big Reputation
Either by your own deeds, or through the family
and role you were born into, you are already well
known and have a following. Increase your influence
by 1. What is the nature of your reputation? Are you
famous for heroism, leadership, or perhaps infamy?
How do you handle the attention and expectations
that come with it? Who are your most loyal
supporters, and do you have any rivals?

1. Unforeseen Destiny
   You have discovered a prophecy or ancient text
   that ties your fate to a significant event or character.
   How did you find it? What does it say about your
   future? Are you trying to embrace or avoid this
   destiny? What challenges does this bring to your
   life?
2. A Hidden Talent
   You possess a unique skill or talent that you’ve
   only recently begun to understand. What is it? How
   did you discover it? Have you learned to control it,
   or is it still a mystery to you? What potential does it
   hold for your future endeavors?
3. An Unlikely Alliance
   You’ve formed a bond with an enemy or rival.
   What brought you together, and how has this alliance

```
changed you? What challenges do you face in
maintaining this relationship? How do others in your
life react to this unexpected partnership?
```

4. Forbidden Knowledge
   You’ve come into possession of knowledge or
   secrets that are considered taboo or dangerous. How
   did you acquire this information? What are the risks

   or does it put you in danger of persecution?
5. Lost Legacy
   You are on a quest to recover something that was

   want to forget? How does this past impact your
   current relationships and choices?
7. The Last of a Kind
   You are the last surviving member of a unique
   group, species, or order. What happened to your
   kind? Do you feel the weight of responsibility as the
   last representative? How do you honor their memory,
   and what legacy do you hope to leave behind?
8. Unexpected Patronage
   You have someone of significant power or
   influence supporting you, but for reasons that are
   unclear. Who is this person, and why have they taken
   an interest in you? What advantages do they provide,
   and what strings are attached to their support?

9. Bound by Oath
   You have made a solemn vow or oath that
   strongly influences your decisions and actions. What
   prompted you to make this vow? What are its
   implications for your life? How does this
   commitment shape your relationships and goals?
10. Secret Identity
    You maintain a hidden identity or alter ego,
    either for protection or for a greater purpose. What
    do you hide from others, and why? How do you

Syncopath
By weakening the connection between your mind
and body, you can open yourself to the psionic winds
that drift across the world. The psionic winds carry
on them the thoughts and emotions of all sentient
creatures, and can be listened to. However,
weakening the link between mind and body comes
with risks—as your mind flows freely with the ideas
and feelings of others, your thoughts can be heavily
influenced by those around you, and your sense of
self becomes vulnerable. There is no “on or off”
switch—as the boundary between mind and self
weakens, there is no going back.
```

```
Tie r 1
```

- The range of your mental powers is 15 feet,
  extending through walls and across physical
  boundaries.
- You gain the ability to roughly sense the
  emotional state of the sentient creatures within
  range. The GM will tell you the emotions being
  felt of creatures within range, but not which
  emotions belongs to which creatures.

- Whenever someone thinks about you while
  within range, you immediately know what they are
  thinking about you, as well as what their overall
  opinion of you is.
- If half or more of the conscious creatures in
  range dislike, distrust, or are in some other way
  associate negative emotions with you, you gain the
  aspect “Self loathing” at rank 1. It can apply a
  penalty to any type of skill check you take.

Tie r 2

- The range of your mental powers increases to
  45 feet.
- Whenever an ability allows you to sense the
  thoughts or emotional state of creatures around
  you, you can determine the direction from which
  those thoughts and emotions came from. When
  continually monitoring thoughts and emotions, you
  can only monitor one source at a time.
- You may choose something you can see, a
  sound you hear, or some other experience you’ve
  had in the last 5 seconds. You can hear the
  thoughts and emotions of all creatures in range that
  are about the subject you chose.
- When you are disliked, your rank in the “Self
  loathing” aspect is 2.
- If half or more of the conscious creatures in
  range have untreated wounds or are in severe pain,
  you gain a level of mental vulnerability.

Tie r 3

- The range of your mental powers increases to
  90 feet.
- Whenever an ability allows you to sense the
  thoughts or emotional state of creatures around
  you, you can pinpoint the exact source of those
  thoughts and emotions.

  and feel the emotions of all creatures in range that
  are about that topic.
- When you are disliked, your rank in the “Self
  loathing” aspect is 3.

  range have a mental condition such as confused,
  charmed, enraged, or frightened, you also gain that
  mental condition, at the highest rank experienced
  by those effected.

```
Tie r 4
```

- The range of your mental powers increases to
  300 feet.
- By focusing on a single person, you can hear
  all of their thoughts and emotions as they occur.

  skill, you wish to do so as well. Treat this as a rank
  4 aspect.

WIP Paths

Physiarch
Rather than letting your body regulate itself,
you’ve learned to control it with fine precision with
your own mind. This grants the ability to heal faster
and enhance your strength and agility via your
mental focus, but at the cost of energy expenditure
and mental capacity.
```

```
Tie r 1
```

- You require twice as many rations each day.

  maximum hit points costs two less XP.

  choose to alter one superficial feature of your face
  or body to a different, healthy, and realistic state.
  For example, making your nose larger, your arms
  hairier, or your eyes a different color. Doing this

  to your original state. You cannot accurately
  replicate the appearance of anyone in particular
  using this ability.

  day.

  enraged, you lose all benefits from this kit.

```
Tie r 4
```

  day.
- While dazed you lose all benefits from this kit.
- When you decrease a wound’s rank from a
  long rest, decrease its rank by five instead.
- Whenever you take a long rest, you may
  choose to fundamentally alter your body. You can
  accurately replicate the appearance of anyone of
  any race. If that race has any racial abilities due to
  some physical trait, you gain those racial abilities.
  If your race had any abilities due to physical traits,
  you lose those abilities. The GM has final say on
  which abilities are gained and lost.

them ranks.
Your relationship with your god is represented by
divine favor. As you gain more of it, you have more
sway with your god. As spend it, you lose it.
```

```
Tie r 1
```

- Each day you must spend 15 minutes dedicated
  to your god. Whatever this activity this is, be it
  prayer, meditation, making music, or anything else,

  divine favor. You can have a maximum of ten
  divine favor.

  their follower. You may spend one point of divine
  favor to have access to any one of these talents
  until the next dawn. Talents chosen must be
  approved by the GM to ensure they fit the thematic
  character of the god. Each additional talent you
  choose to access costs one additional point of
  divine favor.
- You may spend points of divine favor on a skill
  check in which one of your god’s aspects applies
  as though the aspect was your own. You may spend
  up to two points of divine favor each time you do
  this.

  points of divine favor to ask for a miracle. It is
  entirely up to the GM to decide what occurs.

## Misc. Other Rules

Le a r n i n g a La n g u a g e

With structured, high quality lessons, learning a
new language will take from six months to a couple
years, depending on the complexity of the language.
When you wish to learn a new language, the GM
will select a difficulty for that language. That is the
number of successes you need on monthly cunning
checks to become fluent in that language (generally
6–30). It takes half that number of successes to have
a passable proficiency, and a quarter of that number
to understand the most basic words and phrases. The
difficulty of those cunning checks depends on the
circumstances under which you are learning the
language. Use the following table to calculate the
difficulty.

```
Other Long Term Tasks
Whenever you wish to take on a multi-day task,
especially if it will take months or even years, you
can use the following framework to determine
progress. Examples of this would include crafting
custom armor, recruiting an army, converting people
to a religion, and building a boat.
The framework is as follows. The GM should
first determine the timeframe of checks. This could
be days, weeks, or months. Then, they should
determine the absolute minimum amount of these
time-blocks that would be necessary to complete the
task, given the best possible circumstances. Lastly,
they should set a CN based off of your specific
circumstances. You may roll against this CN once as
each block of time passes by, so long as you spend
that time working towards your long term goal.
```

Quick Combat

Extensive rules for full combat are laid out in the
next chapter. However, there are times when it is
clear that you will defeat your opponents easily, and
using the full rules for combat can be more trouble
than it’s worth. If this is the case, you may want to
use these quick-combat rules.
The party should place the outcomes in the
following list in order of priority, with the most

```
important outcome at the top of their list. Then, a
player must roll a might, agility, or cunning skill
check four times, contested by a CN set by the GM
representing the difficulty of the encounter. For each
failure, the failure outcome on the lowest priority
item occurs, and then that item gets crossed off the
list. If the number rolled is less than half of the CN,
then the epic failure results occur instead. If the
```

```
La n g u a g e Le a r n i n g C h a l l e n g e
CN Circumstances
```

```
6 <7 y/o, phenomenal teacher, or complete immersion
```

```
9 Daily lessons from a fluent speaker
12 Half-immersion
15 Self-taught, no interaction with fluent speakers
```

number is greater than the CN, then the desired
outcome occurs.

- We suffer no injury - Failure: Everyone takes d2, rank 10
  wounds.
- Epic failure: Everyone takes d4, rank 10
  wounds.
- None of our opponents escape
  - Failure: A few escape
  - Epic failure: All opponents escape
- We get what we want
  - Failure: We get some of what we want,
  - Epic failure: We get nothing
- Nothing else goes wrong
  - Failure: Minor complication
  - Epic failure: Major complication

## Influence

Your influence is a general measurement of your
social power in society. As you gain fame or infamy,
your influence will increase, opening doors that were
previously closed to you.
When you first create your character, unless
otherwise noted, you start at zero levels of influence.
You can consult the following table to see the
approximate levels of influence of other people in
society.

```
Tr a de
See the Traders & Merchants rules section for
details. However, in summary, higher influence
allows you to find buyers and sellers who are willing
to buy or sell more product.
```

```
Social Encou n ters
Whenever you are interacting with someone who
has influence greater or less than you, the imbalance
of power can have powerful affect on the
effectiveness of your communication. At the GM’s
discretion, they may add levels of advantage or
disadvantage to rolls to intimidate, persuade, or
deceive to either member of a social interaction—
usually equal to half the difference in levels of
influence, rounded down.
For example, if a king, of influence 6 is trying to
persuade one of his subjects of influence 2, the king
would reasonably be granted 2 levels of advantage
on the roll. Likewise, if a peasant of influence 1 was
trying to intimidate a nobleman of influence 4, they
would have a level of disadvantage.
```

```
Influence Ranking
Le v e l Examples
1 Unlikely to be known by anyone outside
their community. Ex: Local smith, stable
boy, farmer
2 Likely known by a dozen or more people
outside their local community. Ex: Sherif,
trader, minor gang leader
3 Well known by dozens of people outside
their local community. Ex: Wealthy
merchant, local representative, expert
craftsman
4 Known by many people inside and outside
their immediate community who haven’t
met them but recognize the name. Ex:
Leader of a moderately sized settlement,
important sage, crime boss
5 Their name is known by at least some
people across the entire region; they wield
great power. Ex: Minor to middling nobility,
military general, minor regional hero
6 Their name is known everywhere within the
region and even beyond; they wield stately
power. Ex: state leaders, minor dragons,
regional heroes, minor daemons
```

```
7 There name is well known by nearly
everyone across multiple countries in a
region. Ex: very powerful state leaders,
dragons, legendary heroes, major daemons
8 Their name is widely known by most people
across multiple continents. These figures are
living myths, and exist in single digit
quantities across the world. Ex: the most
powerful daemons, figures from widely
shared mythology
```

```
Le v e l Examples
```

At t e n dan ts

As you gain influence, you may gain attendants
as well. Attendants are close servants who personally
serve you. You may get to know your attendants, but
they will not fight for you—they stick around to
serve your mundane needs in exchange for a share of
your prestige. They travel with you wherever you go,
have no cost, and if they die, a new one can usually
be found to take their place.
Different types of attendants exist that serve
different kinds of purposes. Each attendant, with the
exception of the generic type, will only do things
related to their title. For example, a footpad could
not make checks to heal you, and an interpreter
could not make checks to find clues at a crime scene.
However, occasionally, your attendants’ skills or
safety may be challenged. In these cases, you make
all rolls for your attendants. Treat all of your
attendants’ abilities as d6s. They have a 40 maximum
hit points and a d8 heart die, but will always retreat
or surrender in a fight. When making skill checks,
you may add your influence to their roll.
Although you can hire more attendants to cover
more of your needs, additional attendants will
require personal investment of game-time and/or
currency, while the ones granted from your influence
come for free.
When you reach level 4 influence, you gain one
attendant. At each level beyond 4, you gain an
additional attendant, and may switch out any number
of your attendants. You may gain attendants at any
settlement that is not hostile to you.

Cook

A personal cook prepares your meals for you.
They know what foods are edible and which ones
aren’t, and they can prepare a hearty meal to keep
you healthy.

```
While you have a cook, you cannot be poisoned
from foraged food. Additionally, so long as your
cook has a properly stocked kitchen, eating their
breakfast increases your hit points by 2X (but not
greater than your hit point capacity), where X is your
influence. Your cook can prepare food for up to 6
people, who all gain these benefits.
Multiple cooks do not cause stacking effects.
```

```
Disciple
A disciple is a student of your form of combat.
They seek to learn to fight the way you do, and will
follow you into combat unless told otherwise.
While you have a disciple, they will participate
in any fights you get into unless forbidden or
otherwise unable. They remain by your side
whenever possible, though are controlled by you.
Rather than roll combat for them, it is assumed they
help you. You may add half of your influence to your
A/D rolls.
```

```
Footpad
A footpad is your trusted, undercover servant,
capable of minor scouting missions and petty theft.
While you have a footpad, you can have them
scout out a settlement for a number of interesting and
valuable people, objects, and locations equal to your
influence.
Additionally, you may task your footpad with
shadowing a person. They make a stealth check
contested by the cunning challenge number of the
target. On a success, you can receive daily updates
on the target’s activities and location.
```

```
Healer
A healer may act as your assistant in your own
healing, or may personally attend to you when you
get back from a fight.
While you have a healer, they automatically
succeed on any checks to treat wounds less than or
```

equal to your influence, and automatically succeed
on checks to perform first aid on creatures with a
maximum wound level equal to or less than your
influence.

Interpreter

An interpreter understands, can speak, read, and
write many languages. They will act as a personal
translator for yourself and your company.
When you gain an interpreter, they can
communicate in all mediums in a number of
languages equal to your influence. Whenever you
gain influence, you can add a language. Your
interpreter can interpret for you and your party and
anyone you wish to speak to.
If you wish to switch languages known by your
interpreter, you will need a new interpreter.
Interpreters can not interpret magical languages.

Porter

A porter carries your gear for you, so you don’t
have to.
A porter can carry a number of slots equal to 30
times your influence level.

Sage

A sage is an expert in a field, and acts as your
personal, small walking library of knowledge on a
subject.
When you gain a sage, choose a subject. Rather
than make your own knowledge checks on that
subject, you may query your sage. They make the
same check, but add your full influence level rather
than half to the roll. They have advantage on the roll.

Apprentice

Apprentices are your personal mentees. They
seek your guidance and tutelage in a particular field
that you have become experienced in.

```
When you gain an apprentice, choose a field of
work, such as alchemy, smithing, or Deoric casting.
It can be nearly any profession, though your GM has
final say.
While you have your apprentice, you have
advantage on all skill checks made on tasks related
to your profession.
You can only have one apprentice at a time.
```

```
Smith
A personal smith will keep you and your party’s
weapons and armor in pristine condition, and can
make minor adjustments and tools out of metal.
While you have a smith, you and your party have
+1 to all A/D rolls, so long as you have allowed your
smit to tune up the weapons within the last month.
Multiple smiths do not cause stacking effects.
```

```
Stable Hand
A stable hand takes care of your animals. They
make sure they are well fed, taken care of, and in
good condition.
While you have a stable hand, you can travel
20% further each day while riding on an animal
cared for by your stablehand.
A stable hand can take care of up to 6 large
creatures, or 2 L2 creatures. For creatures larger than
L2, it requires a number of stable hands equal to the
size of the creature (L3 requires 3, L4 requires 4,
etc).
```

```
Body Guard
Body guards act as the last line of defense
between you and those who seek to have you dead.
They remain with you at nearly all times, and will
sacrifice themselves to keep you alive.
Body guards will not fight for you, and they
never partake in typical combat. However, if you
would take potentially lethal damage while outside a
typical combat (such as a falling rock, a sneak attack,
```

or a midnight assassination), they may be able to
save you. Whenever such an event might occur, they
take damage up to 10 times your influence level
before they die and any leftover damage is dealt to
you. This might take the form of them tackling you
out of the way of a large source of damage, or using
their life as the necessary distraction to prevent a
potential killer.
Multiple body guards do not cause stacking
effects. If you want additional safeguards, you will
need to find them through other means.

```
Gaining Influence
Influence is hard to gain, though not impossible.
Ultimately, it is up to the GM to determine when a
player should gain influence, but they should consult
the following table as guideline. In each table, the
right two column are ways that a player could gain
influence, while on the left column it shows the
minimum influence level of a player who’s met any
of the criteria in the row.
```

# Followers

If a player is a leader of a faction, is a religious
leader, or is a daemon, use this column to determine
their influence.

```
# Profoundly Changed Lives
If a player has saved people’s lives, conquered
them, or in some other way had a profound impact
on people, use this column.
```

```
Influence # Followers # Profoundly changed Lives
2 10 50
3 100 500
4 1,000 5,000
5 10,000 50,000
6 100,000 500,000
7 1,000,000 5,000,000
8 10,000,000 50,000,000
```

```
Influence Tr a de R ou t e Le n g t h (miles) Flaunting of riches (du c at)

3 100 5,000
4 1,000 50,000
5 5,000 500,000
6 - 5,000,000
7 - 50,000,000
8 - 500,000,000
```

Tr a de R ou t e Le n g t h

If a player is a trader, use this column. Note that
after a certain point, you cannot raise your influence
any further from being a merchant.

Flaunting of Riches

If a player shows off their wealth in some way,
such as by constructing something opulent or
revealing an impressive heist, then use the value of
whatever object they are showing off to determine
where they sit in this column.

## Strongholds

Strongholds represent loci of power for players.
Although not necessarily literally strongholds, they
act as recurring bases of operations for the activities
of the players. They can provide income, followers,
influence in exchange for maintenance and care.
Examples of strongholds include palaces, forges,
colleges, and inns, though many more exist.
Strongholds can be owned by multiple players.

Building Your Stronghold

In order to gain a stronghold, the owner must pay
an amount of ducat equal to the square footage of the
stronghold they wish to construct. If there are special
features of the stronghold, such as those listed in the
price modifiers table, then those price modifiers are
multiplied by the base price for the final cost.
Different types of strongholds have different
minimum levels, which you must also meet in order
to build them. It is up to the GM to determine how
long building any particular stronghold takes, though
it is suggested that building it takes between six
months and two years, and upgrades take about half
as much time.

```
During construction, and upon completion, it is
assumed that your stronghold becomes populated
with whatever folks are typical of the type of
residence. Shopkeepers, stable masters, craftsmen,
servants—these people and more will arrive and
begin working in your stronghold. Some of these
people would typically require payment to work
here, while others would typically pay taxes; don’t
bother keeping track of the specifics—all of this
flow of money is wrapped up in the initial cost of
construction and income generated by your
stronghold thereafter.
```

Miscellaneous Rules

```
Upgrading Your Stronghold
Upgrading your strong hold is as easy as paying
the difference in prices between the current value of
your stronghold and the new value of your
stronghold.
```

```
Option Price Modifier
Island x2
Mountain-top x3
Underground x3
Underwater x5
Floating in the air x10
Wondrous materials x15
```

```

5 195x195 feet 38,000
6 275x275* feet 77,000
7 420x420 feet 175,000
8 500x500+ feet 250,000
```

```
*This is a bit less than the size of a typical city block
```

Multiple Strongholds

If you wish to own multiple strongholds, they
must share physical proximity. This could mean
building a large library stronghold in your castle
stronghold, or it could mean attaching a wizard
tower stronghold to your laboratory stronghold.
What’s important is that your presence and identity
is closely tied to each of them, and they share a close
connection to each other, which is not possible if
they are hundreds or thousands of miles apart.

Types of Strongholds

In exchange for their enormous costs,
strongholds have substantial benefits unique to each
type of stronghold. Regardless of what type of
stronghold you choose, you and the stronghold’s
inhabitants and owners all have advantage on rolls
made to defend your stronghold.

College

_Minimum level 2._
A college is a place of learning and further
education. This could be academic or scholarly in
nature, or it could be a training grounds, built to
teach one the arts of fighting or espionage. As the
leader of a college, you have influence on the great
minds of the next generation.
In order to build a college, you must also build a
library at a level no less than half the level of the
college, rounded up. This ratio must be maintained
as you level up your college.
As your college grows and people graduate, you
attract some of the graduates as followers. Whenever
you upgrade your college to another level (or for
each level beyond 2 that it was built at), you gain a
level 3 follower with a focus on whatever is taught at
your college.

```
At level 5 your college can offer a more
advanced program. You gain a level 4 follower, and
another one for every subsequent upgrade.
At level 8 your college is one of the most
prestigious places of learning in the world. When
you upgrade to level 8, you gain a level 5 follower.
```

```
Guild House
Minimum level 2.
You are the leader of your own guild house. As it
grows, it will become the hub of business for all of
your chosen field.
A guild house generates 10% of it’s total value
every year.
Guild house owners gain a level of advantage for
every level of the guild on ability checks for business
interactions that take place in the guild.
Additionally, gaining the services of the guild is
discounted at a rate of 5% per level of the guild
house.
```

```
House
Minimum level 1.
Your house is your personal haven—a place to
unwind and relax, store your belongings while
traveling, and to host parties.
All owners of the house gain the free aspect of
“Just want to get home safe” at a rank equal to the
level of your house. You can invoke this aspect
whenever you are doing anything to help you get
back home after going out adventuring.
Once per month, you may throw large social
events at your house. When you throw the event, in
addition to regular friends and folk, X people of
influence 1 higher than your current influence show
up, where X is the level of your house. During these
events, stronghold owners may treat their influence
as though it was one level greater than it is for the
purpose of making connections and socializing with
any guests.
```

Additionally, your house contains one attendant
per level of the house. They live at the house and
will not come with you on your travels. If the
attendant has abilities that normally only affect one
person, they instead apply to all owners of the house.
If the attendant has abilities that scale off of
influence level, use the level of the house instead.

La b o r a t o r y
_Minimum level 2._
Alchemy bonus
You sell product, can cover cost of purchasing
materials.

Li b r a r y
_Minimum level 1._
Your library is a great repository of knowledge.
Whenever you wish to learn something known by
50,000 people or more, you may roll on the
following table on a row corresponding to the level
of your library. On a 1 or 2, that information is
present in your collection. Another column exists for
information known by 1,000 people or more.
Whenever your library increases in level, you may
re-roll checks to determine if your desired
information is present.

Starting at level 2, and once again for each level
thereafter, through trade and scouting, your librarians
find and add a book of significance in a field of your
choice. Talk with the GM to determine the specifics

```
of the contents of the book discovered. The book
cannot be so rare that it is the only copy that exists.
```

```
Sanctuary
Minimum level 2.
A sanctuary is a place of elemental focus. If you
share an elemental attunement with the sanctuary,
meditating within it can be refreshing and
empowering.
When you create a sanctuary, choose an element.
That element is imbued into building during
construction. When you take a short rest in this
sanctuary, all spells of the corresponding element are
refreshed. I
When you upgrade your temple to level 3,
choose a spell from the same element as the
sanctuary. After a short rest within the sanctuary, if
you are attuned to the same element as the sanctuary,
you gain the ability to cast that spell until you take
your next long rest.
When you upgrade your sanctuary to level 4,
your own abilities with the element of the sanctuary
improve. While within your sanctuary, if you and the
sanctuary share an attunement to an element, treat
your attunement to that element as one level higher.
When you upgrade you sanctuary to level 8, the
sanctuary’s magic lasts with you longer. Whenever
you take a short rest within your sanctuary, if you
and the sanctuary share an attunement to an element,
treat your attunement to that element as one level
higher until you take your next long rest.
```

```
Shop
Minimum level 1.
Shops can cover a wide variety of types of
constructions, including banks, mercantile outlets,
and any other stronghold that you want to be more
focused on the money-making aspects than anything
else.
```

```
Le v e l 50 , 000 1 , 000

6 d4 d8
7 d2 d6
8 d2 d4
```

A shop generates 13% of it’s total value every
year, plus another 2% for each level of the shop.
You have advantage on checks to determine the
authenticity and value of items handled by your
shop.

Tav e r n

_Minimum level 2._
Your tavern is a social place where people from
all over can relax, potentially spend their night, and
hopefully some of their wallet too. Taverns include
inns and bars, as well as any other hub of
entertainment, such as a theater or fight-ring.
Your tavern generates 13% of its total value
every year.
Taverns attract people from all walks of life, with
stories from all over the world. Once per week you
can query for rumors about any subject. Roll a die on
the following table corresponding to the level of
your tavern. On a 1 or a 2, you hear a substantive
rumor about your subject.

Training grounds can be anyplace that you can
practice your preferred form of combat. You may
spend a day training with a particular weapon in the
training grounds. If you do, you get +1 to all rolls
with that weapon. This bonus lasts until you spend
time training with a different weapon instead.

## Chase

A chase starts out with a chaser and their prey,
each positioned on a number line. The chaser starts
at 0, and the prey start at some distance from chaser,
usually between 2 and 4.
Over the course of the chase, the chaser and prey
will move up the number line. If the difference
between them ever grows to 6 or more (the GM
should feel free to adjust this before the chase,
depending on the environment), or if the person
being chased reaches a target number (a safe
location, determined by the GM), then the chase
ends and the prey has escaped. If at any time the
chaser and the prey are on the same space on the
number line, the chase is over, and the prey has been
caught.
Alternating turns, starting with the chasing party,
each party can take up to one action and then move
once.
The action can be literally anything logical that
you should be able to do in a chase. Leaping up to
the rooftops, ordering for people to move out of the
way, disappearing into a crowd—these are all valid
actions, depending on the situation. When you take
one of these actions, the GM should set a CN for
how difficult it is to pull the action off successfully.
On a success, and if the GM thinks it would provide
a reasonable advantage, they give you an appropriate
reward from the following: Take A Shortcut, Fast
Lane, and Slow ‘Em Down. These are detailed
below.
Note that not every situation necessarily has an
action that can be taken to effectively change the
distance between parties.

```
Take a Shortcut
You go someplace hard to find, access, or pass
through, allowing you to make substantial progress
towards your goal. When you leave this space, you
may skip the next space.
```

```
Fast Lane
Either by finding a faster means of travel or
using a vehicle of some sort, you have found a way
to consistently move faster than your opposition.
Whenever you move, you may move one additional
time.
```

```
Slow ‘em Down
You disrupt the terrain behind you, forcing those
following you to slow down. Your current space
requires one additional movement to leave for
anyone else.
```

```
Movement
After possibly taking an action, the active party
may move once, incrementing their position on the
number line by one.
In addition to actions and moving, on each turn
you may also choose to exert. When you exert, make
a CN 8 endurance skill check. On a success, you
may move an additional time at the end of your turn.
Regardless of if you succeed or fail, the CN
increases by 2. If you rolled less than or equal to half
of the CN, your means of transport is exhausted. If
you were moving under your own power, you are too
tired to continue. If you were in a vehicle, your
vehicle crashes.
```

Catching the Prey

If the chaser catches the prey, the chaser starts
wherever they wish in a spot behind the prey. If they
wish to enter combat, they automatically go first,
even if the other party wishes to retreat.

## Deoric Magic

Deoric is the language of truth. The language is
extremely complex, but whatever is spoken in the
language, when fueled with enough energy, simply
become true. Hypothetically, you could do anything
from changing the color of your freckles to altering
the nature of time. However, energy for Deoric
magic comes only from living sacrifice, and using
Deoric magic to affect other living things is even
more difficult. For these reasons, Deoric is
frequently referred to as ritual magic, or witchcraft,
because it is usually performed in private, over long
periods of time, at the cost of life.
Making things even more difficult, Deoric is an
absurdly cryptic and complex language. In order to
make the magic occur, the desired outcome must be
described in excruciating detail and with perfect
grammar, pronunciation, and rhythm. Simply
knowing the words to a few common objects will not
come even close to allowing you to control them.
Furthermore, the consequences of misspeaking can
be enormous. While in general, a mispronunciation
results in nothing more than the spell fizzling out,
mixing up words can also lead to equally powerful,
but unintended effects. The subject of Deoric
research is an intense one—riddled with catastrophic
and lethal failures throughout.
Many people don’t know any Deoric, and those
who do, very little. Instead, people read from
existing texts, sounding out familiar words and
sequences of sounds as they go. Entire books exist
describing how to perform only a handful of Deoric
spells. Due to the intense costs of failures, most
choose to chant Deoric spells many times before
releasing the energy with the sacrifice, thereby

```
reducing the risk of a single misspoken syllable
negating the entire spell.
Deoric is also used in handmagic, oaths, and
most magical artifacts. In each of these cases, the
Deoric is stored in some object (your hand, a scroll,
an item), and can then be activated for its effect. We
will cover these aspects of Deoric magic in a later
section.
```

Casting a Spell

```
Although anyone could theoretically cast Deoric
magic simply by sounding out the words, the odds of
successfully casting are nearly nonexistent. On the
other hand, learning the entire language in all of its
minute complexities would take eons—both to learn,
as well as to track down the tens of thousands of
ancient and obscure words, lost to history. Instead,
people generally choose to focus on different
domains of Deoric to specialize in. This way, a
Deoric magician may be proficient in spells
involving the creation and manipulation of stone, but
incapable of destroying it, or turning it into water.
There are many different domains of Deoric, and
your proficiency in any domain will be given a rank,
starting at 0. Although your rank in a domain could
theoretically go up indefinitely, most people don't
achieve over a 3 in their lifetime, and the knowledge
of the gods rarely range above 5 or 6.
```

```
Spell Components
One of the most important factors in casting
Deoric spells is determining the spell’s stats. There
```

are no predetermined spells in this rulebook—
instead, each spell is made up by the players or the
GM. However, there is some consistency between
spells. **Every spell is made up of varying ranks in
at least one domain, one technique, and three
modifiers.** These ranks determine the energy cost of
the spell, as well as how difficult it is to cast, if you
can cast it at all. The first step is determining the
ranks of the components of the spell.
To assign ranks to the spell’s components, the
spell should be described in detail, explaining
exactly what it does and how it causes whatever
effect it creates. Then, use the domain, technique,

```
and modifier charts to assign that spell a rank in each
of its components. Examples are included in a later
section.
```

```
Domains
There are twelve domains of Deoric knowledge.
The ranks assigned to each level of control over that
element are rough—they are designed to help you
arrive at a value, not explicitly point one out to you.
Based off the description of the spell, assign it a rank
in ever domain relevant to the spell. Every spell
should have at least one domain.
```

Te ch n iqu e Next choose the relevant technique for the spell.
Their are five techniques of Deoric magic, listed in

```
Domains

the table below. When calculating the rank of a
technique for any given spell, it should be roughly
equal to the average cost of the domain components
of a spell. However, in some circumstances a

```
technique will be harder or easier. In these cases,
adjust the rank of the technique up or down by one,
or even two, if the technique is especially easy or
hard.
```

Modifiers

There are three modifiers to every spells, which
change their behavior, listed in the table below.

```
Choose a rank for each modifier for your spell, based
off of the range at which your spell works, the
duration it lasts, and amount of precision it requires.

(Summoning)
```

```
Nothing can be created or destroyed using Deoric—but you can summon things from the
surrounding area. Unless specified, it could come from anywhere. Some things are more
difficult to summon than others, due to their scarcity (e.g. gold, titan blood). After
summoning something, it does not return to wherever it was summoned from.
Mindoran
(Understanding)
```

```
Used for comprehension, scrying, and effects on the mind. Seeking information that is
“harder to get” can make the rank of this component higher.
Taziin
(Banishment)
```

```
Just as nothing can be created, nor can anything be destroyed—only sent somewhere else.
Unless specified, this could banish the target of the spell anywhere.
Ostum
(Control)
```

```
One of the most common techniques. Used for controlling the behavior and movement of
some domain. It is more difficult to make something behave in a way that is more unnatural
to it.
Phreo
(Transform)
```

```
Used for changing the properties of a domain. Small changes require less work than large
changes. After transforming something, it will not necessarily revert to its previous state, if
that would require more energy.

Determining Spell Cost

A spell’s cost can be calculated by multiplying
the technique and modifiers together (note: not the
domain rank). Keep note of this number and save it
for later.
For example, making the wooden chair glow
would be level 1 (1 x 1 x 1 x 1) , while making a
small tornado would be level 36 (3 x 2 x 3 x 2), and
destroying the poison would be 3 (3 x 1 x 1).
When determining spell cost, the GM is at full
liberty to increase or decrease ranks of individual
components of a spell at their discretion. These
variations can be explained by the finicky nature of
Deoric spell casting.

Ta r g e t i n g a S u b j e c t

If you wish to target a living creature with your
spell, you must first determine your intent. There are
two levels of intent one can have: neutral or positive
intent, and negative intent.

you must also take into account the subject cost
of your target. Living things are extremely complex,
and without knowing a creature’s true name, you
have to describe the creature in all of its complexity
rather than use a single word to identify it. This
makes casting spells targeting living things much
more difficult. If you do cast a spell targeting a
creature, first determine the subject cost, using the
following table.

```
After determining the subject cost of your spell,
multiply the spell cost by the square of the subject
cost. For example, let’s say the spell to remove
poison from a dead human body costs 5 energy. If
that body is alive, that same spell now costs 45 (5 x
32 ). If you know the true name of the subject, the
subject cost becomes one.
```

```
Deoric Knowledge
In order to actually cast a spell, you must meet
two requirements: energy, and knowledge. We have
already covered calculating the spell cost, so we will
now cover how knowledge of domains and
techniques affects the casting.
For each domain and technique of Deoric, you
will have an associated rank of knowledge. By
default, a new character starts with zero ranks of
knowledge in each domain and technique. As you
increase your ranks of knowledge, it will allow you
to invent new Deoric spells, as well as have higher
odds of success at casting Deoric spells.
```

```
Casting the Spell
When casting a spell, there are two things to
determine. The first is if you are reading the spell, or
reciting it from memory. Reading it is more likely to
result in a successful casting, but is often less
convenient.
```

```
Subject Costs
Subject Cost
Small creatures 1
Medium-sized, non-sentient creatures 2
Magical, non-sentient creatures, most
humans
```

### 3

```
Mythical creatures 4
Heroes 5
Dragons 6
```

The second thing to determine is your
comfortability with the domains and techniques used
in the spell. If your rank in knowledge for the
domains and techniques is greater than or equal to
the ranks defined in the spell, than you are much less
likely to fail. On the other hand, if you do not meet
the knowledge requirements, you won’t even be able
to cast the spell unless you are reading from a
written source, and even then, you may fail.

Situation 1: You Are Reading, and You Have

the Knowledge

If you are reading the spell, and your knowledge
rank for each component in the spell is equal or
higher, then there is no check you need to make—
you pass.

Situation 2: You Are Reading, and You Don’t

Have the Knowledge

If you are reading the spell, but you don’t meet
the knowledge rank for each component in the spell,
then for each difference in ranks, square it and add it
to a running total. Then add 12. This is the challenge
number for casting the spell. After casting the spell
but before the spell takes effect, make a Deoric spell
casting (cunning) skill check against the CN. On a
failure, the spell fizzles out, or worse, backfires.
Refer to the Miscasting & Fizzling Spells section
later in this chapter.

Situation 3: You Are Reciting, and You Have

the Knowledge

If you are reciting the spell from memory, and
your knowledge rank for each component in the spell
is equal or higher, then there is a chance for you to
misremember the spell and mess it up. Take the spell
cost for a spell before accounting for its subject cost
(if any). Make a Deoric spell casting (cunning) skill
check against this number. On a failure, the spell

```
fizzles out, or worse, backfires. Refer to the
Miscasting & Fizzling Spells section later in this
chapter.
```

```
Situation 4: You Are Reciting, and You Do
Not Have the Knowledge
Unless otherwise stated, you can not cast the
spell. Attempting to do so automatically results in a
spell failure. Refer to the Miscasting & Fizzling
Spells section later in this chapter.
```

```
Supplying the Energy
When you cast a spell, you must also have the
necessary energy to power the spell. This energy is
called spirit energy, and it comes from spirits,
funneled into a spell. Since spirits disappear shortly
after death, this usually requires live sacrifice.
To determine how much spirit energy is required
to cast a spell, refer to the spell cost of the spell.
Each sacrifice provides energy equal to its subject
cost (see the Subject Costs table above) towards the
spell. So long as the sacrifice is made within a
minute before the spell ends, the spirits go towards
fueling the spell.
When casting a spell with a subject, the spirits
must be powerful enough to overcome your target. In
these cases, the sacrificed spirits must be of equal or
greater subject cost when compared to the target of
your spell. For example, if you wanted to cast a spell
on an average human, you could use human
sacrifices, or even dragon sacrifices, but wouldn’t be
able to use rodents.
Likewise, when the spell is complex or powerful
enough, it also requires higher level sacrifices. Look
at the highest rank of domains used in a spell. To cast
that spell, sacrifices must come from a creature with
a cost equal to that number or higher.
If upon casting a spell, there is not enough
energy to cast the spell, the spell misfires. The
```

energy must be available before the spell ends. If it is
not, you may achieve partial success, though the
exact results are up to your GM to determine.

Ti me To C ast

The last factor to consider when casting a spell is
the time it takes to cast. Although spells are just
spoken sentences, they are long and complex, and
ensuring their perfect enunciation requires time.
Furthermore, most mages choose to repeat the spell
over and over again to increase the likelihood of
fixing any minor mistakes made in the first runs. The
correct and incorrect pronunciations average out
over time, thereby reducing the odds of a single
mistake sabotaging the spell. For this reason, the
time to cast a spell is variable; you can always
choose to cast faster, at greater risk.
To determine the time and risk of casting a spell,
use the _Spell Speed_ table below. Use the rank of the
spell’s technique component to determine the spell
speed. The column on the right determines how long
it takes to cast the spell safely. Note that you cannot
change the nature of a spell once you have begun
casting it. For example, if your spell is going to
create a large rock over someone’s head so that it
falls and kills them, you would have to pay the
subject cost if you wanted the rock to be created
wherever they had moved to by the end of the spell
cast.
If you wish you may choose to cast the spell in
the time from the row above its position. If you do,
make a CN 10 Deoric spell casting skill check
(cunning). On a success, you cast the spell in the
shorter time. If roll less than a 10, but greater than or
equal to a 7, you are aware of your mistake, and may
choose to use the rest of the time. If you roll less
than a 7, you are unaware of your error, and miscast
the spell at the end of the duration.

```
If you wish to cast a spell even more quickly, you
may go up two rows instead of one, although the CN
is 20 instead of 10.
```

```
Miscasting & Fizzling Spells
Sometimes, deoric casting goes awry. When
every word is critical to the execution of a spell,
even the slightest mistake can lead to disaster.
Whenever you fail the deoric knowledge check
to speak the spell, or if you attempt and fail to cast
the spell more quickly than is safe, roll Xd6, where
X is the amount you missed the CN by. Add the
results of the dice. The GM may now describe the
result of your spell. Nothing worse than the
description in your result’s corresponding row can
happen.

```

Le a r n i n g D e o r i c

One of the key ways to increasing Deoric power
is by gaining ranks in the domains and techniques of
Deoric power. Gaining ranks in either spell
component happens in the same way.

Le a r n i n g D o m a i n s a n d

Te ch n iqu e s

Learning Deoric is similar to the way in which
you learn any language—just much harder. Use the
CN from the Learning a Language section to
determine the CN for each check. Rather than
making monthly checks to learn, you must make
checks only once per year, after studying for the
duration. The number of successes required to reach
the next rank in a domain or technique is listed in the
table below.

```
In addition to time, you also need source
material. In order to increase your rank in a domain
or modifier, you must be able to study a spell that
contains a component of the rank you seek to reach.
Once you have used that spell to gain a success at the
end of the year with your language learning check,
you cannot use that spell for further successes
towards the same rank. For example, if I want to
reach rank two in Vul, I need to have access to a
spell that I can read that requires Vul 2 as one of its
components. If I succeed on my language check at
the end of the year, I cannot use that same spell to
continue learning towards rank two in Vul. If that
book also contains a spell that requires Vul 3, I
cannot use that to satisfy the requirement for source
material, since it is too advanced.
```

```
Inventing Spells
Spells can be invented, as well as learned. In
order to invent a spell, you must first describe and
determine stats for that spell, as described in the
previous sections. If you do not have the ranks in the
domains or techniques corresponding to the spell’s
domain and technique ranks, you cannot invent the
spell. The GM may also determine that the spell you
described requires specialty knowledge, even more
specific than the general ranks in each domain you
could gain, in which case you may have to achieve
other, specific conditions set by the GM.
If you do meet the requirements, however, then
you may begin work. Each week you may make a
CN 15 Deoric spell invention (cunning) check. Once
you have a number of successes equal to the spell
cost of the spell, you have learned how to cast the
spell, and can write it down or commit it to memory.
```

```
16–20 Something negative and permanent
but not lethal occurs to one or more
people, major destruction to
immediate area
21–25 One or more people are lethally or
very negatively and permanently
affected, mass destruction
26 Catastrophe occurs

Enchantments &

Artifacts

While the energy used to cast a Deoric spell is
usually used up in the casting, some materials bear
naturally energy producing or storing properties, and
can be enchanted with Deoric magic to become
magical artifacts. Since the materials of the artifact
provide some of the energy for the magic, artifacts
can have magical properties that remain potent
indefinitely. For example, a sword that can be always
activated to erupt in flames, or a magnifying glass
that reveals an examined object’s history when used.
Different materials have different magical properties,
which can make them more or less suited for
different enchantments.
In order to create an artifact, you must have the
crafting skill to create the item if it doesn’t exist
already, the runescribing skills to engrave the artifact
in Deoric runes, and the Deoric knowledge of the
spell in order to know what to write. In addition, the
object you are enchanting must have the magical
capacity for the spell you wish to enchant it with.
Larger objects have more magical capacity, and more
magical (and typically therefore more expensive)
materials have more magical capacity.

Magical Capacity

Every artifact has some magical capacity which
defines how powerful the spells contained can be.
Larger artifacts, made of more magically potent
materials, can store more powerful spells, while
smaller artifacts with less valuable materials can
hold only weaker spells. To determine the capacity
of an item, sum the value of the all of the magical

```
materials used in the item. You can see the values of
each material in the chart below.
When you enchant an item, the item must have
magical capacity greater than or equal to the spell
cost of the spell you wish to enchant the item with.
Upon enchanting the item, subtract the spell’s spell
cost from the capacity of the item to get the new,
remaining capacity of the item. A single item can
have multiple enchantments on it, so long as it has
the capacity for all of them.
```

```
Enchanting the Artifact
To enchant an artifact with a Deoric spell, you
must meet all of the knowledge requirements for the
domain and technique of the spell, as well as the
additional energy costs.
Although the materials of the artifact provide
some of the energy, sacrifice is still required to
enchant an item. With higher sacrifice, the item can
be used more frequently, while with less sacrifice, it
```

```
Materials With Magical Potency
Material Cost per Lb
Obsidian 5
Silver 20
Dragon Bone 60
Dragon Blood 100
Gold 6,000
Gems 7,500
Platinum 10,000
Red Gold 20,000
Titan Blood 25,000
Titan Bone 25,000
Astrum 50,000
Malstaric Ash 50,000
```

can only be used rarely. To determine how much
additional soul energy is required for a specific
frequency of casting, refer to the table below, and
multiply the energy cost of the spell by the energy
multiplier from that row.
While enchanting an artifact, the required soul
energy is used up and channeled into the artifact
throughout the process. Each day, you must spend 8
hours in a workshop with access to engraving tools,
and must contribute an amount of spirit energy no
less than the energy required for a full casting of that
spell. Once you have contributed an amount of spirit
energy equal to or greater than the total soul energy
required for the enchantment, you are finished
enchanting the item. This takes a minimum of one
day.

Setting the Activation

The last step in the enchantment process is
determining the activation trigger for the spell stored
within your artifact. There are several types of
triggers you can create, determined by your skill as a
runescribe and enchanter. Unless otherwise stated,
you can only craft items that can be activated at
extremely slow speed.

```

The spell is activated after one hour of use.

## Tr a de r s & Merchants

Money is what makes the world go around, and
in the world of Alaria, it is no different. If you are
interested in making money at a large scale through
trade, this section is for you.

Making Money

Every settlement has an economy around buying
and selling roughly the same goods. For example,
almost everyone needs food and clothing, and most
settlements also need stone, lumber, beer, salt, and a
large number of other “core” resources. However,
some settlements are producers of those goods, or
are adjacent to one, and therefore have a surplus of
that good, and others have deficits of that good, and
therefore have high demand for that good. This is
where you come in.

Prices

Every settlement has a rating for its size, which
determines how many buyers and sellers there are, as
well as at what level. Then, for every common good
(see the _Common Goods_ table below), there is a level
of need. This reflects if this good is in demand, or in
surplus, and at what level of magnitude. The rating is
secretly determined by the GM, but will reflect
availability of that good in the area. Also note that a
settlement will only ever have demand or surplus for
a good—never both (since then those people would
just trade amongst themselves until there was no
more surplus or demand). This rating determines the
price of any given good within a settlement.

```
To find that price, look at the demand/surplus
modifier for that good. If the good is in demand,
multiply the price of the good by this number. If the
good is in surplus, divide the good’s price by this
number. The end result is the approximate price for
that good in that location. While you, as a merchant,
may (and should) approximate this value yourself,
the “true” value is determined, and held secretly, by
the GM.
```

```
Bu yers and Sellers
In order to take advantage of this price, you must
be able to find buyers and sellers. Even if individual
people want to buy or sell some good, you cannot
turn profit by making individual sales—you must
buy or sell in bulk. For this, usually only
shopkeepers and other local merchants can be your
customers.
To determine the number of buyers or sellers in a
settlement, the GM should first look at the good you
are interested in buying or selling. If it is in surplus
in this settlement, there are only sellers. In contrast,
if there is demand for this good, then there are only
buyers. If the rating is 0, then there are an equal
division of buyers and sellers (rounded in either
direction, at GM discretion). Then, take the value in
the bonus traders column of the Surplus & Demand
table, and add it to the value listed in the buyers/
sellers column of the Settlements table.
For example, if furs were in moderate demand
(1d4 - 1) in a small town (+1), then the number of
buyers would be equal to 1d4. Or, for example, if
bricks were in extreme surplus (1d4 + 1) in a hamlet
(+0), then the number of sellers would be equal to
```

1d4 + 1. Or, if honey was neutral (1d4 - 3) in a
metropolis (+4), then there would be 1d4 + 1 buyers
and sellers, split evenly between the two.

Securing a Buyer or Seller

When you come to a settlement, you can choose
to spend a day looking for a buyer or seller of a
particular good. That time is spent perusing shops,
visiting guilds, and performing more general
information gathering techniques. While this part of
the day will likely not be played out, actually
meeting the buyer or seller will.
When you meet a buyer or seller, the GM will
roll a die equal to the value in the buyer/seller level
column of the _Settlement_ table, and then add your
influence, up to the maximum level listed in the max
level column. This is the level of the trader, and
represents how many units of goods they may be
willing to buy or sell to you at the given price. From
this point on, it is up to you to secure a price you
want. Although an approximate base price has been
calculated by the GM using the supply/demand table,
it is up to you to find the best deal that you can.
Once you have agreed upon a price, you may
transfer a number of goods to the trader up to or
equal to their level, and get paid your agreed upon
price.
If you wish, you may continue looking for buyers
and sellers of the same good, or you may look for a
buyer or seller of a different good. In either case, this
still takes a day, and follows the same process.
Once you have a made a deal with a one or more
buyers or sellers in a settlement, you may always
return to that settlement to make the exact same
exchange of money for goods, once per month. You
do not need to find new buyers or sellers, and you do
not have to haggle for a new price (though you may
do either of these things if you wish). Although a
trader may disappear, or wish to renegotiate prices,

```
this will not typically happen except when the GM
decides it makes sense.
```

```
Tr a de R ou t e s
At the heart of being a successful merchant is
identifying and exploiting lucrative trade routes.
While it’s possible for a trader to constantly travel,
buying and selling whatever they deem fit, it is much
better to automate this so that the merchant’s time
can be spent elsewhere. This automation takes the
form of trade routes.
Trade routes are cyclical paths connecting a
collection of settlements, in which the starting and
ending settlement are the same, and the quantity of
purchases and sales in every settlement along the
way remains in equilibrium with each pass through
the cycle.
Although there are no specific rules dictating
special properties of trade routes, it is heavily
recommended that you develop them, as they allow
you assign the job of actually traveling between
settlements and executing the trades to someone else.
In order to count as a trade route, there must not
be any sort renegotiating on prices and quantities for
each good at each stop in the trade route, and there
must be a settlement of origin, where your trade
route begins and ends. Once this has been confirmed,
your trade route’s profit can be calculated by looking
at the total revenue from completing a trade route
and then subtracting the maintenance costs for
whatever vehicles were used for that time. This
money can then be picked up from your settlement
of origin after each cycle of the trade route is
completed.
```

```
Milestones
As you improve as a trader, you unlock certain
benefits, due to a combination of your influence,
```

wealth, and experience. Each milestone is unlocked
once you achieve its prerequisite achievements.

Tr a de r: Novice

_Establish 20 miles worth of trade routes._
You know how to identify who’s more likely to
buy or sell a lot. When you enter a new settlement,
you may ask the GM to roll the level for each buyer
or seller in the settlement, and announce their levels
to you. You may meet them in any order.

Tr a de r: Amateur
_Establish 100 miles worth of trade routes._

```
Your minimum influence level becomes two.
```

Tr a de r: Professional

_Establish 500 miles worth of trade routes_
You have gained an intuition about where pirates
and thieves may lie. You have A3 on all checks to
predict their presence, including when you research a
trade route as well as while actually traveling it.
Your minimum influence level becomes three.

Tr a de r: Expert

_Establish 2,000 miles worth of trade routes._
You can find a better deal on most things. If you
find an item being sold, if it is not a unique item, and
it costs less than 50,000 ducat, roll 1d100. If you roll
under 50, you know someone else who’s selling it at
a price at that percentage discount on the price you
originally found. The GM will tell you their name
and how you know how to contact them.You may
use this ability once per month.
For example, if you found a magical knife that
costed 40,000 ducat, you could use this ability and
roll 1d100. If you rolled a 25, then the GM would
tell you that you actually know a friend, “Andre”
who sells that exact item for 30,000 (40,000 - 25% x
40,000). The GM will tell you how you know (or

```
know of ) this person, as well as where they are and
how you could contact them.
You may use this ability on bulk purchases as
well, so long as each individual item of the bulk
purchase costs less than 50,000.
Additionally, your minimum influence level
becomes four.
```

```
Tr a de r: Master
Establish 10,000 miles worth of trade routes.
You have connections everywhere. If an item is
on the market in any of the markets your trade route
touches, you can use your trade network to locate a
buyer or a seller. You may use this ability any
number of times for items that not unique, and only
once per month for unique items.
Additionally, your minimum influence level
becomes five.
```

Complications &

Other Factors

```
These rules outline what things will look like
when everything is going nicely. However, there are
several other factors to consider when implemented
in an actual game.
```

```
Ta x e s
Taxes are a huge concern for merchants, and
they’re often a pain to avoid. Most cities and large
ports have tariffs on imported resources. These
usually range from 2–5% of imported value, but their
exact rates are us up to the GM, as well as if they
exist at all. Fortunately, bribes, smuggling, and other
trickery can be used to get around these. As a player,
```

it is up to you to decide if you want to avoid these,
and if so, how.

Weather

The second bane of the merchant lifestyle is the
weather. Weather can lead to delays, damaged
shipments, or no shipments at all, such as if a ship
sinks at sea. When the GM approximates the time it
takes from one settlement to another, they should
take this into account. In addition, if you are
traveling some place where shipments could be
damaged, the GM may choose to place a percentage
loss on profits based off of how likely they estimate
these damages to occur.
Lastly, the GM may decide that weather has
caused an entire shipment to disappear. Usually, this
is cause for player investigation, but if you are
shipping goods through a dangerous area, this may
just be a cost of doing business.

```
Pirates & Thieves
The last thorn in the side of merchants come
from the pirates and thieves who steal merchandise
in transit. As with weather, this may just be a
constant cost to your shipments, or, it may be a
source of further adventure. The GM should think
carefully about where pirates and thieves reside, and
where and how they go about stealing.

## Running a Ship

Ship Health

Every ship has at least three components: Hull,
Sails, and Steering. They are the three most critical
components to any ship, and their state of repair
should be tracked when players own their own ship
and its management is central to the game. Sky ships
and ice breakers will have a fourth component—the
engine—with rules listed here as well.
Each component on a ship can be in four states
of repair: new, weathered, broken, and irreparable.
When bad stuff happens to a ship, it can cause the
state of one or more of its components to fall. A new
ship will start with all of its components in the
“new” state. If the ship is used but nothing is broken,
the ship’s components will all be either “new” or
“weathered”. Components in the “weathered” state
have no penalties, but are closer to breaking. When a
component becomes broken or irreparable, it comes
with special consequences to the ship and crew,
listed in the next sections.

Sails

Sails include all their related equipment, such as
masts, sails, and lines. When sails become broken,
the ship moves at half speed. Broken sails represent
shredded sails, a crack forming in the mast, or
destroyed or missing lines. If the sails become
irreparably broken, the ship cannot move. If your
mast breaks or your sails are destroyed, then the sails
are irreparable.

```
Hull
The hull is critical to the structural integrity of
the ship, making up the entire outer shell of the boat
making contact with the water. When the hull is
broken, the ship has sprung one or more minor leaks.
If the leak/s are not addressed soon, the ship will
eventually sink. A ship with a broken hull will
automatically enter the irreparable state after 24
hours if the hull is not repaired. An irreparable hull is
one that has one or more massive leaks, and is no
longer capable of staying afloat. The ship cannot be
repaired, and will sink in the next hour.
```

```
Steering
The steering includes all parts of the ship critical
to maneuvering the ship, such as the rudder, keel,
helm, and gears and shafts connecting the helm to
the rudder. These parts of the ship are generally more
fragile and will break easily if exposed to
unexpected forces. When the steering is broken, you
cannot change course or make course corrections.
You move in the direction of the wind (chosen at
random by the GM). You may choose to move at full
speed in that direction if your sails are unfurled.
When the steering is broken,
```

```
Engine
Icebreakers and airships have aether engines,
critical to their locomotion. Aether engines require
massive fuel tanks of aether and some complex
machinery for turning that aether into physical
rotation used to turn massive propellers. When the
engine is broken, it will not run. Any benefits
conferred by your ships engine are lost. In an airship,
```

this means you cannot change altitude or exit an
astral current. In an icebreaker, this means you
cannot break ice.

Ship Repair

When a component of your ship is weathered or
broken, it can be repaired. Repairing your ship is a
camp action. It takes four camp actions to return a
component from broken to weathered. To return a
component to the new state, a brand new component
must be installed. The cost and work required for this
is up to the GM.

## Armies

When large numbers of combatants collide, it
may become more useful to use the rules for armies,
rather than individuals. These rules are intended to
make large battles play out in a way that feels
cinematic and more narratively satisfying than
simply rolling a single die and declaring a victor.
They allow one or more players to control troops in a
battle against one or more other enemy forces.

Units

Every army is composed of units—similarly
sized groups of combatants who fight as a group.
Because different battles happen at different scales, a
unit consists of however many soldiers can fit on a
single square of a battle map. If the battle map scale
is 1:25, this may mean that a single mountain giant
counts as a unit, while 25 human soldiers also count
as a single unit. If the scale is instead 1:100, then one
unit could consist of four mountain giants, or 400
soldiers. Before any big battle, it is important to

```
determine the scale so that you can allocate your
soldiers into units. Scales that result in 5–15 units are
usually best.
```

```
Allocating Units
Once you have determined the scale of the battle,
it is time to allocate your soldiers into units. For
example, if the scale of our battle was 1:25, if you
had 300 infantrymen, 100 cavalry, and 50 archers,
then you would have 12 infantry units, 4 cavalry
units, and 2 archer units.
After determining which units are included in
your army, you can assign their stats. Details on how
these stats are used will be described later, but for
now, just focus on the troop name in the table below,
and whether it accurately describes your unit. If you
have a unit that is not included in the table, find its
closest approximation, or else come up with your
own stats. It is ultimately up to the GM to approve
the stats of your unit, but they will be using the same
guidance as you.
```

```
5 6 d6 1
```

Officer Units

When there are troops, there must also be
officers—those in control of managing those troops
on the battlefield. For every four units in an army,
select one of them to contain an officer. If a troop is
ever more than four spaces from an officer, then the
unit loses discipline and is disbanded. This means
that the troop either flees, surrenders, or gives up at
fighting, and should be removed from the board.
If the unit containing the officer is ever
disbanded, or if the officer is killed, isolated, or
otherwise prevented from communicated, then the
unit no longer counts as containing an officer,
potentially causing nearby troops to be disbanded as
well.

```
Commanders
At the head of every army is its commander—the
person in charge of the operations and tactics of their
troops, and in charge of all of the officers. This could
be a trustworthy NPC, or even a player. In either
case, they must be chosen before a battle begins, and
a new commander cannot be selected until the battle
is over. As with officers, they reside in a unit.
Choose one of your units to contain the commander.
Just like with officers, if an officer unit is ever more
than eight spaces from the commander, then the
officer unit is disbanded.
If the commander dies during a battle, is isolated
from their army, or is otherwise no longer capable of
giving commands to their troops, they lose. It doesn’t
matter if all of their troops are still healthy—all order
and discipline is lost, the battle is over, and the

```

```

enemy achieves whatever they were trying to
accomplish.

Battlefield

Before playing out a battle, it is also important to
lay out the battlefield. If there are walls or
barricades, draw them out as lines between spaces. If
there is a river, fill in squares as impassable or
difficult. All of these things should be drawn out on a
battle map, at a scale equal to the unit size of the
troops in the battle.
After drawing the map, determine which army is
defending. In nearly every battle, there are the
people who are occupying a location, and there are
the people who want to take that location from
them^1. The first are the defenders, and the latter are
the attackers.
First, the commander of the attacking army must
determine in which direction they are attacking from.
This should be announced to the defending army, as
unless otherwise stated, they would be able to see
their attackers
Once the attacker has declared a direction of
attack, if you are the defending army, you get to lay
out your units, wherever and however you wish.
Make sure to keep all troops within range of an
officer, and all officers within range of your
commander.
After the defending army has done this, the
attacking army may place their troops. Unless
explicitly allowed, each unit must be placed at least
6 spaces away from the closest enemy troop, or
further, and must be in a position that the GM deems
reasonable, given their direction of approach. If the
defender would have been able to see the attacker’s
approach from further away, they may choose to

```
force the attackers to place their troops at a more
distant range instead.
```

Battle

```
A battle takes course over rounds—each
containing a turn for the attackers, and then the
defenders.
On the attackers turn, each unit can be moved in
a straight line up a number of spaces equal to that
unit’s movement speed. The line must not intersect
with any other unit on the map—even diagonally,
and it must end in an open space. When determining
diagonal distances, count the first diagonal as one
space, the next diagonal as two spaces, and then one
again, and so on.
After each unit has been moved, that player may
make attacks for each of their units. To make an
attack with a unit, that unit must have an enemy unit
within range. For melee units, that means it must be
adjacent (this includes diagonals).
When making the attack, the attacking and
defending units should each roll their power die. If
the defender rolled lower than the attacker, the
defender loses morale equal to the difference. If this
would result in the defender have zero or less
morale, then the unit is disbanded, and removed
from battle.
```

```
Special Units
At the most basic level, that is all there is to
combat. However, there are a few, common types of
special units that have unique rules.
```

(^1) If you are certain that both sides are attackers (such as the unlikely scenario in which both sides are meeting in open ground with the sole purpose of
killing each other), then have the commander of each participating army making an operations (cunning) check. The loser must place their troops
first. If there are more than two armies clashing, proceed in order from lowest to highest.

Ranged Units

Ranged units usually have a range greater than
one, allowing them to attack units more than one
space away. All units have disadvantage when
making defense rolls against ranged units. When
ranged units make defense rolls, they automatically
roll 1s.

Aerial Units

Aerial units are units that can fly. When they
move, they can move through other units, and they
can end their movement on top of another unit. In
addition, they can only be attacked by ranged units
and other aerial units.

Siege Units

Siege units are really just spaces that have
equipment on them (such as siege engines, or
mounted ballista). Rather than attacking, a unit may
choose to man a siege unit. While doing so, that unit
takes on all of the stats of the siege unit except for
morale, which is inherited from the unit that is
manning the siege unit.
When siege units make defense rolls, they
automatically roll 1s.

Fortifications & Terrain

Besides units, there may also be fortifications
and terrain effects on the battlefield. A space can be
marked as a fortification. If so, it will have some
number of hit points. So long as it has hit points
remaining, all troops within the space gain a flat
bonus to their defense rolls determined by the stats
of that fortification. Additionally, melee attacks
cannot be made from a fortified area to a non-
fortified area, and vice-versa.
Fortifications can only be damaged by siege
weapons. When a siege unit attacks, it can choose to

```
target a fortification, in which case all of its damage
goes directly to the fortification.
```

```
Players on the Battlefield
Can be officers, can be commanders, can be elite
fighting force.
```

```
During combat, a unit can move a number of
squares equal to its movement speed. It can only
move in a straight line, and that line cannot pass
through any other units. It can then attack any unit.
Whenever you attack with a unit, roll that unit’s
power die. The defending unit also rolls their power
die. The defender takes damage equal to the
difference.
Infantry and other non-cavalry grounded, melee
units have disadvantage on defense rolls against non-
adjacent (ranged) attackers.
Ranged defenders automatically roll the
minimum on any defense roll.
Cannot move through another troop, and your
own troops count as difficult terrain.
People with better commander take their turn
first.
Aerial units can only be attacked by ranged
attackers and other aerial attackers. They can be on
the same square as another unit.
```

```
Tac t i cs
Passive ability. You are commander.
Can force a unit to come forward one space if
you retreat (taunting it, luring it in. This could cause
it to leave the range of commander/officers).
```

```
Commander
```

Must move first, then attack. No movement after.
Can move extra space if you don’t attack.

```
Misc terrain effects:
```

- High ground: advantage on attack and defense
  rolls. Ranged attackers have +1 range.
- Difficult terrain: move reduced by half,
  rounded down, minimum of one.
- Fog: Can’t see anything beyond immediately
  adjacent tile.

```
Player interaction:
```

- Can join a troop to give a bonus to it
- Can play as commander
- Or do missions
  - Scout: Figure out where troops are

```
If you kill enemy commander, they lose.

## Magical Crafting

Any bit of magical crafting begins with its
components—a collection of magically potent
materials that will be combined to create the product.
Metals, gems, bloods, powders, horns, teeth, and
hides are all examples of potential magical
components.
Every component has two properties, each
determined at the GM’s discretion. First is its level.
This determines how powerful of an effect that
material can create. Second are its tags. Tags are
used to describe the type of magical ability
associated with a material. For example, pixie dust
could be a magical component. The GM may then
decide that it is a level 4 component with the tags
“psychic”, “air”, and “illusion”. The GM may also
decide that they want silver to be a level 2 magical
substance, and because they don't think it has any
specific magical properties, give it the “neutral” tag.
The GM should refer to the following sections to
determine the power level and tags of a component.
For examples of magic items, and their level and
tags, refer to Appendix C.

Power Level

The power level table is used for determining the
level of magical items as well as their components.
When determining the power level of a component,
the GM should assign it a level corresponding to the
highest power level one could feasibly achieve if the
component was the most critical component to an
item’s function. For example, let’s assign the power
level to a unicorn horn. As the GM, imagine that the
most powerful item we think the horn could
reasonably be used as the center piece for was a

```
“unicorn horn wand” that could powerfully charm
multiple people at a time. With this vague idea in
mind, we can assign it a power level of 4, since that’s
roughly the power level of that wand.
```

```
Tag s
The tags table is used for determining which tags
belong to a component. With the exception of the
“neutral” tag, all tags have a specific flavor of magic.
If a component feels like it meets the description for
a tag, that tag belongs on the component. For any
material or component that feels like it might be used
```

```
Power Level
Le v e l Power Level Description
1 Not powerful. More cosmetic, or flavorful
than anything else. +1 bonus to skill
checks..
2 The power of a talent. Roughly 2.5 damage
per round, or a +2 bonus to skill checks.
3 The power of a talent with its destiny level.
Roughly 5 damage per round, or a +3
bonus to skill checks.
4 A substantially powerful effect, such as a
paragon level. Roughly 8 damage per
round, or a +5 bonus to skill checks.
5 An incredible effect, but not one that could
be described as legendary. Multiple
paragon levels, for example. Roughly 20
damage per round.
6 Wondrous effects, potentially able to
instantly kill commoners. Not necessarily
one-of-a-kind, but probably. Their locations
are likely known throughout history—they
are viewed as legendary artifacts.
7 Beyond legendary.
```

in a magic item, but it doesn’t necessarily have a
specific use, it should likely receive the “neutral”
tag. For example, as the GM, if you want precious
metals and gems to be prevalent in all sorts of
magical items, they should have the “neutral” tag.

Crafting the Item

```
Before you can begin crafting the item, you must
first determine if you are following a procedure or if
you are inventing. If you have a blueprint, plan, or
recipe, or have one memorized, then you are
following a procedure. If you’ve never made
something before and are hoping to create a desired
effect, then you are inventing. Each involves
different steps.
```

```
Following Procedure
When following procedure, the GM will tell you
the level of the item you are crafting and the required
components. You must have each of the required
components, and you must have an aspect related to
crafting of rank equal to or greater than the level of
the item you are creating. Proceed to the Crafting
Check section.
```

```
Inventing
When inventing, the details of what you are
trying to make need to be ironed out first. Describe
to the GM what you want to make. Work with them
to determine the exact details of what the magical
item does, how often it can be used, and any other
properties of the item. As the player, it is ultimately
up to you to determine the stats of the item you wish
to create. With the stats clearly defined, the GM
```

```

```

```
Tag Description
```

should then determine the power level of the
described item using the _Power Level_ chart. This
process should be collaborative between the player
and GM.
After determining the level, the GM should
decide what types of components the item requires.
An item recipe should require at least one
component with a tag relating to each unique effect
of the item, and should require a total number of
components equal to the level of the item. If the total
number of specific types of components don’t sum to
the level of the item, the remaining components
should be neutral components. All components must
be of an equal or greater level than the crafted item
itself.

Crafting

Once you have determined the level and the tags
of the magic item, you can attempt to craft it. For
each tag on the magic item, you must have a
corresponding, distinct component of level equal or
greater than the level of the magic item you are
trying to craft. You must also have an aspect of rank
equal to or greater than the level of the item you are
creating.

Crafting Check

You have the necessary ingredients, it is now
time to actually make the item. Successfully crafting
an item requires X successful crafting skill checks,

```
where X is the level of the item you are trying to
craft. Crafting must also be done in a crafting
workshop, of level equal to or greater than the level
of the item being crafted. After every X days you
spend working in the workshop, make the crafting
skill check. The CN is equal to 8 + 2 * X.
On a failed skill check, progress for that period
of work does not count—you must work another X
days to make another check. On three consecutive
failed skill checks, the item is ruined, all progress is
lost, and a random component is wasted in the
process.
However, once you have a number of successful
crafting checks equal to the level of the item, you
have finished.
```

```
Following Procedure
If you were following a procedure, it is much
easier to make craft an item without making
mistakes. You have a +8 on your crafting skill
checks.
```

```
Inventing
If you were inventing, make one final crafting
skill check upon completing an item, representing
your skill as an inventor. On a success, you have
crafted the item with the desired effects. If you fail,
you have still successfully crafted a magical item,
but it does not have the exact intended behavior. It is
entirely up to the GM what the properties are of the
magic item you have created.
```

```
Refining Components
Sometimes the components you have are not
high enough level to make what you want. If this is
the case, you may wish to use alchemy to refine a
component into a shard. A shard is a purer form of a
magical material, distilled to its magical essence.
```

```
Example
Let’s say you want to craft a fiery great sword.
You describe it as giving a creature one level of
burning whenever you deal damage to it with the
sword. The GM would determine that this is of
roughly level 3, and would have the tag “fire” but
nothing else. It would therefore require one level 3
fire component, and two level 3 neutral components.
```

To craft shard you must have two, non-shard
materials of the same level and with the same tags,
and you must have access to an alchemy lab of level
equal to or greater than the level of the components
for the duration of the refinement. You may then
spend a number of days refining equal to the level of
the components. After those days, both components
are destroyed and you gain a shard—a magical
component with the same tags as its ingredients, and
of one higher level. Components with only a neutral
tag cannot be refined into shards, and shards cannot
be refined into more shards.

Crafting

Wor kshop

```
In order to craft magical items, it is necessary to
have at least some type of workshop dedicated to the
task. A workshop contains all the necessary tools,
reference materials, and specialized workstations
necessary for magical crafting. Every workstation
has a level. Higher level workstations are larger and
more expensive, but can make it easier to craft
magical items.
The following table contains the requirements for
each level of workshop. Required equipment is
cumulative, so each level of workshop requires all
the tools necessary from each previous level.

Item Description Cost

Animal Products

In most cases of magical crafting, the
components will come from animals. Below are the
most commonly used animal parts used in magical
crafting.
In order to harvest items from a creature, you
will likely have to make a harvest check with a CN
set by the GM. The difficulty of this will vary by
product and creature.

Le a t h e r

Hides can be used for armors and some crafting.
Nearly all hides can be fashioned into light or
medium armors, though some will also work as
heavy armor.

Feathers

Feathers provide very little protection, but
magically aided abilities in flight are sometimes held
within a creature’s feathers.

Scale s

Scales are much harder to harvest than leather,
but can be used in both armors as well as some
crafting.

Fangs, Spines & Horns

Fangs, spines, and horns can usually be crafted
into piercing melee weapons. In the case of
particularly straight edges, they can also be used as
arrowheads.

Claws & Talons

Claws and talons can be crafted into slashing
weapons. Usually the weapons cannot be heavy, as
the slashing area is relatively small.

```
Bones
Bones are versatile. They can be shaped into
weapons or trinkets, or they can be ground up and
used as powders in alchemy. Usually bones do not
possess much magical capacity, though if there is
any, it is usually concentrated in the creature’s skull.
```

```
Blood
Blood can be used in crafting potions, or it can
be dried and used as a powder or paste applied
during crafting. In the case of magical creatures, the
potion may grant the drinker some of the properties
of the creature during its life.
```

```
Heart
Like blood, the heart may be used in potion
crafting. In some cases, the heart can also be used for
crafting by harvesting the heart-strings. The heart is
generally more potent than the blood. Sometimes,
the heart might have some magical effects even if the
blood does not.
```

```
Brain
In creatures with powerful mind effects, the brain
can sometimes be used in potion crafting to capture
some of the creature’s magical ability.
```

```
Vocal C hords
In creatures with magically superior voices,
vocal chords can be harvested to capture some of the
creature’s magical ability.
```

```
Eyes
In creatures with magically superior sense of
sight, the eyes can usually be harvested to capture
some of the creature’s magical ability. They can
either be ground up for alchemy, or petrified in use
with crafting.
```

Venoms, Poisons & Toxins

Venoms, poisons, and toxins can be turned into
poisons and contact poisons. Some can also be
turned into poisonous gasses. Most creatures can
produce one dose of poison per day while alive, and
can have 3 doses harvested off of them on death.

Ink

Some creatures produce ink, such as octopus.
besides more mundane uses, such as for writing or
art, the ink may have magical properties that can be
used in alchemy or crafting.

Te ar s

Tears are some of the most difficult and taboo
alchemical components to procure, as they require

```
the creature to be alive and crying when they are
harvested. However, some of the most powerful
magic is occasionally held within a creature’s tears.
```

```
Hooves
The hooves of a creature with magical movement
speed may contain some magical power.
```

```
high level smithing requires a “god forge”,
something-crucible
Alchemy: Something-crucible.
```

All possible properties, as well as a brief
description of each can be found below:

The first is that all crafting has a difficulty. The
difficulty is a CN which determines how challenging
that item is to make.
The second is a duration. Different items take
different amounts of time to craft.
Lastly is a material cost. Material is measured in
weight, and is used up when you craft items.

The first thing to know is that the magic of
magical crafting comes from the components of the
objects made. Unlike Deoric or Kethic, making
magical items does not require any magical
capability of the crafter—it uses the magic entirely
from its materials.

Smithing

```
Smithing is the general descriptor for any sort of
forging, smithing, or crafting of weapons, shields, or
armor. For example, a bone mask that provides a
bonus to defense, an arrow made of a basilisk spine,
and a shield of astral steel are all examples of
smithing.
If you want to make something that falls under
the category of smithing, then there are three
important values to know—the
Use the following table to calculate the smithing
difficulty, time to craft, and material mass required.
To determine the difficulty, take the difficulty and
add any modifiers for the item type that applies. For
example, a heavy, bludgeoning, stone club would be
calculated as follows:
7 (base CN for adapting) + 1 (material cost) + 2
(heavy weight) + 0 (bludgeoning) + 0 (melee) = 10.

Alchemy

Alchemy is the process of transforming raw
ingredients into magical substances. Brewing
potions, refining magical components, and
concocting arcane substances are all examples of
alchemy. For example, making poisons, explosives,
and invisibility paint are all examples of alchemy.
Alchemy differs from artificing in that the
alchemical products are used up rather than sticking
around forever.
Despite this difference, the rules of alchemy are
nearly identical to those of magical crafting. The
level of your final product is estimated, tags are
determined, and components with corresponding
level and tags are used to produce a final product.
Differences are laid out below.

Inventing

Whenever you produce something new via
alchemy, you must determine how much of the
product you intend to create. By default, you
produce 10 uses of that item. For example, if you are
making a poison, you have 10 doses of that poison.
If you are producing flash bangs, you make 10 flash
bangs. In cases with more vague units of
measurements (such as invisibility paint) it is up to
you as the player, though it must be approved by the
GM.

Alchemy Laboratory

In order to perform alchemy, you must have the
tools, space, and knowledge to do so. All of those
things are centered in your laboratory—necessary for
any alchemical experiment.
While working in an alchemy lab, you get a
bonus to all alchemy checks equal to the level of the
lab.

```
Le v e l 1
At level 1, you need basic alchemy tools, and 2
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 2
At level 2, you need basic alchemy tools, and 5
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 3
At level 3, you need advanced alchemy tools,
and 10 or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 4
At level 4, you need advanced alchemy tools,
and 20 or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 5
At level 5, you need expert alchemy tools, and 40
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Crafting
In order to craft an alchemical brew, you must
spend time and resources to prepare the substance. In
addition, you must have access to the recipe, either
from a book, or memorized, and you must be in an
alchemy lab of a level equal or greater than the
recipe you are crafting.
When you wish to craft something, it takes a
number of days equal to the recipe’s level. Only two
hours each day must be spent actively working on
the recipe, since the rest of the time is spent waiting
for chemical reactions to occur. If you do not have
the recipe memorized, you must have access to a
written form of the recipe each day.
When you start the crafting process, remove all
the required remarkable materials from your
inventory. Those materials are used up in the
alchemy process. Any gold cost in addition to the
unique materials is spent at a rate of 10 * X ducat at
```

the start of each day, where X is the level of the
alchemical product.
After each day of crafting, make an alchemy skill
check against 8 + 2 \* X, where X is the level of the
recipe. On a success, you make another day of
progress towards finishing the product, potentially
finishing the product immediately. On a failure, all
progress is lost, and you ruin the product.

Recipes

In order to craft an alchemical solution, you must
know the recipe, or be able to follow a recipe from a
book. Memorizing a recipe takes a number of
successful daily memorization checks equal to the
recipe’s level. The CN for the memorization check is
equal to 8 + 2 \* X, where X is the recipe’s level.

Inventing Alchemy

As you progress as an alchemist, you may gain
the ability to invent alchemical products. If you do,
you may work with your GM to define the
properties, costs, remarkable materials, and levels of
any alchemical product. As a player, your
responsibility is to define the properties of a
hypothetical alchemical product. As the GM, their
responsibility is to determine if such a product could
even exist, and if so, to assign it its costs, material
requirements, and level.

Assigning Materials and Level

To determine the level and materials required for
an alchemical product, its level should be equal to
the number of special materials in the product or the
maximum level of the materials used in the product,
whichever is higher.

Followers are like attendants, but have much

My gang vs your nation:
```

- We can both effectively spy on each other
- Nation crushes me in battle
- Individual acts I do can affect nation’s army,
  but it would only matter if we were even
  remotely close
- Nation can buy way more than me
- Although I’m more cohesive, we both suffer
  similar internal struggles
- When it’s a small scale fight, I want to be
  able to participate in it (take over neighboring
  faction)
- On a large scale battle, I need to be able to
  participate in some battles but not all of them.
- I.e. some fights must be abstracted, others
  not. However, the ones that aren’t abstracted
  need to matter more.

```
Tasks PCs must be able to do:
```

- Defend their stronghold from invaders
- Lead faction/or country in revolution against
  country - Plant memory of gnomes entering
  city to shift blame onto them.

```
Need:
Battle rules (for playing out individual battles)

money and resources and intel to undermine another
power
```

- Should be able to force them to change
  policy
-

```
size * might die. Swingier at low levels,

```

Size affects wealth. Wealth determines how
much might you have. Only relevant when you’re
using armies to fight. “army” requires 100 person
population.

Armies only matter when you have company
wealth. Company wealth is a score out of 10. Factor
of size. If it’s rich, it’s one greater than size. If it’s
poor country, it’s one less than size. If it’s absurdly
rich, 2 greater, or 2 less if absurdly poor.

Faction actions are organized into “fronts”. They
have a rank, determining how powerful that force for
change is. For example, Erasnus has a front of

```
“Remove myorna from the trade alliance.” Myorna
contains factions with conflicting fronts: “Remain in
the alliance” and “Remove ourselves from the
alliance and retreat underground”.
Without player interaction, the greater front wins
when appropriate.
Fronts don’t have to be explicitly carried out—
they just succeed. However, counter-actions carried
out by players remove points from front. Front ranks
don’t have to be calculated until the players interfere.
Then assign them.
```

```
Anything faction related is broken into long-term
goals. On successes, you build points towards
reaching goal. Your goal can be to do X, or it can be
to stop some other country from doing Y. Totally
player oriented—other factions just succeed at what
they want to do. When front is opposed, the front has
power equal to size of the faction. Must overcome
the front in order to stop it from happening.
```

```
Must be significantly higher than the neighboring
communities of same territory size (neighboring
settlements if settlement, neighboring countries if a
country). Use all countries/states that you border or
have a road going to. Add one surplus for each
neighboring territory you have more of it than.
Subtract for each neighboring territory you have less
of it than. It it’s equal, or too close to tell, there’s no
difference. Can’t have negative surplus, and can’t
gain more than 3 surplus from a single thing.
```

```
Surpluses:
```

- Farmland
- Mined resources
- Artisans and skilled laborers
- Scholarship
- Cheap labor
- Sky ports

```
Size Example Size Category
1 100
2 200
3 500
4 1,000
5 2,000
6 5,000
7 10,000
8 20,000
9 50,000
10 100,000
11 200,000
12 500,000
13 1,000,000
14 2,000,000
15 5,000,000
16 10,000,000
```

- Sea ports
- Wood

You get a standing army of 1% of population for
a single surplus. You can increase it by .5% as many
times thereafter for another surplus each. Army only
exists after number of months equal to country size.
Can hired in a single month for double the surplus.

Internal Projects

When you wish to improve your faction
internally, unopposed, it costs a single surplus to
begin work on a single project. Projects take a
minimum number of months equal to the size of
faction. Projects are any big task that wouldn’t
happen automatically for any faction of your size. It
can be difficult to judge what counts as a faction
project, but as a rough guideline, it should be at least
as rare as something that only some factions of
equivalent caliber have. For example, a harbor would
count as a project for a city state, since many city
states don’t have harbors. However, you don’t have
to spend surplus on a harbor if your faction
represents an entire country, since many countries
have many harbors.

If you want to deal with a front without having to
interact with it, GM may allow you to fight it by
making your own, counter-front. Requires surplus
equal to front value, plus your size rank. Counts as a
project, therefore costs an extra surplus. For
example, if they are pressuring your country to
collapse in revolution, with force 11 (their country’s
rank), if you are rank 9, you’d have to spend 3
surplus fending that off. Even if you are higher rank
than them, still requires one surplus to apply your
rank as a counter-front.
If you want to destroy a kingdom from internal
rebellion, or some other way act directly hostile to
another country, you can’t apply rank. That is a new

```
front from your kingdom. Requires 1 surplus—new
front. Expected to treat it like normal front that has
to be chipped away at with player action.
```

Persuade neighbors to allow passage of your

More faction ideas
```

Every asset has a power, between 1 and 10, a
type (force, wealth, intelligence).
When might v might, use % dice (m1 / (m1 +
m2)).
When might vs wealth, wealth can’t defend, auto
win for might.
When asset is damaged, rank decreases by 1.

```
Come up with rank out of 10 for any faction.
Might, wealth, cunning.
10: mighty kingdom
8: typical kingdom
6: Powerful city state, very weak kingdom
4: Powerful guild
3: typical guild
2: small club
1: you and your friends
```

When assets attack, they use their attack tag vs
defense tag. Usually same. Add your faction rank to
the roll. On success, attacking asset activates effect,
or may deal damage to defending asset. On failure,
defending unit deals damage (or defensive effect) to
attacking unit.

## Armies

Armies are fairly simple to handle. Any faction
can put together an army. It costs 1 surplus to recruit
1% of your population as a standing army, and 1
surplus for every 0.5% thereafter. This cost must be
paid each year. You may direct and move your forces
anywhere you like, though other factions may not
take kindly to you moving your armies on to land
they consider theirs. You may separate your army
into any size of discrete units—just make sure to
note how many soldiers exist in each unit.

Moving Armies

Most of the time, it is not important to keep track
of how quickly you can move units around—
nothing’s stopping them, and there’s no hurry.
However, during times of war, it can be important to
know exactly how long it takes to move a unit from
point A to point B.
A unit moves at a rate of 20 miles a day, and has
influence in a radius of 100 feet times the number of
people in the unit, to a maximum of 2 miles. If
another unit comes within this range of influence,
they may enter battle with the other unit. This is
important because it allows units to block
chokepoints; one army can’t slip past another in a
mountain pass—if one wants to fight, they have to
fight.

Battle

When carrying out a battle, the player should
take the size of their unit and divide it by the
combined sizes of both units, then multiply it by 100.
This is the target number. They then roll a d100. If
they roll under the target number, the player is
victorious! Otherwise, they suffer defeat.

```
Regardless of win or loss, both units must
disband 10% of their troops from casualties. Then,
compare the target number to the number rolled. If
the victor rolled between 1 and 20 more than the
target number, it was a minor victory. The defender
must choose to either give up ground, or to disband
20% of the troops in their unit, rather than just 10%.
If the victor rolled between 21 and 50 more than the
target number, it was a major victory. The defender
must give up ground and disband 30% of the troops
in their unit, rather than just 10%. If the victor rolled
more than 51 greater than the target number, it was a
route, and the defender must give up ground and
disband 60% of the troops in their unit, rather than
just 10%.
```

```
Giving Up Ground
When you give up ground, your unit no longer
prevents the other unit from moving past it for a day,
and your unit cannot move for a day. In the case of
failing to defend the mountain pass, the opposing
army would now free to march through the pass, on
towards your towns and cities. In the case of
defending a city, it means retreating from the city—
thereby granting the city to the attackers. Sometimes,
when in the case of a siege for example, the attacker
giving up ground has little to no effect, since the
troops within the walls of a castle have no reason to
leave.
```

```
Disbanding Troops
Disbanded troops are troops that have either died
or fled the battle, never to return. When you disband
troops, remove that many troops from your unit,
rounded up.
```

```
Situational Effects
In every battle, there is an attacker, and a
defender. The attacker is instigating, and the
```

defender is trying to hold a position. The attacker
wins if they can eventually destroy or dislodge the
defender, and the defender wins if the attacker gives
up. Before figuring out situational bonuses,
determine who is the attacker, and who is the
defender. If there truly is no attacker or defender,
there are no bonuses that are awarded. Otherwise,
apply any of the following bonuses and penalties, if
applicable:

- High ground: If the defenders have a clear
  terrain advantage, such as a narrow chokepoint or
  the high ground, multiply their effective troop
  count by 1.5.
- Fortified: If the defenders are behind fortified
  walls, multiply their effective troop count by 3.
- Unprepared: If the defenders were caught
  completely off guard by the attack, multiply their
  effective troop count by 1/3.

their units. If this is the case, they

Rules

This section includes a few more rules if you
want a bit more crunch to your combat. They only
build on the basic rules for armies.

Specific Troops

You may choose to include more specificity than
just “regular soldiers”. In this case, the GM will
allocate special traits to enemy troops, and will allow
player armies to pick up special traits as well, where
reasonable. Some example traits are listed below:

- Orcs: Large - These troops count as 1.5 troops
  for the purpose of determining the result of a battle
- Cavalry: Quick - These troops count as 1.2
  troops for the purpose of determining the result of
  a battle, and can move 50% further each day.
- Ix Tyrann: Vicious - Opposing units lose an
  additional 10% of their troops, regardless of a win
  or loss.
- Trolls: Regenerative - These units lose half as
  many troops whenever they disband.

spreading their word, and acting in their stead.

After making an attack roll against a target, but
before you deal damage to it, you may offer an
outcome other than damage. The target must choose
which option. For example, let’s if you were about to
deal damage to a guard, you may offer to instead
disarm and steal away the guard’s weapon. The GM
may then decide which outcome occurs. You get to
decide any mechanical effects of the damage-
alternative, though they must be described before the
GM chooses.
Destiny Level
```

Contact-Effect Substances

There are various types of balms and ointments
that can be applied to weapons to give them contact
effects. These contact effects are effects that are
applied only when the substance makes contact with
blood, so they are used primarily on piercing and
slashing weapons.
Unless stated otherwise, these substances
remains active on a weapon indefinitely, and are
used up whenever you deal damage the first time
with that weapon.
In addition, unless otherwise stated, the
application of a contact-effect substance takes one
minute, and requires the use of a paintbrush or some
other applicator. A CN 10 substance application
(agility) check must be performed to avoid wasting
the substance.
One bottle of a contact-effect substance contains
10 doses.

Digestible Poisons

Digestible poisons are ones that only poison you
upon being digested. They have no effect unless they
are swallowed. Usually, they are more potent than
contact poisons, with more severe and potentially
long lasting effects.
One bottle of poison contains a single dose.

Friendliness

There are five levels of friendliness people have
between each other. Close, friendly, neutral,
unfriendly, and hostile. Someone who is close will
act charitably towards you, expecting nothing in
return. They likely will fight for you. Someone who
is friendly may take some minor inconveniences to
help you, but will not put their life or livelihood at

```
risk for you. Someone who is unfriendly may go
slightly out of their way to make your life worse.
Hostile creatures may risk their life or livelihood to
make your life worse.
```

## Factions

Followers are those who ascribe to your
ideology. One in every hundred followers will
actively convert other followers, which roughly
counteracts the passive loss of followers as people
are attracted to other ideologies. For this reason, the
number of followers you have remains neutral.
Devotees are passionate ideologues who share
your desire for a different world. They will be named
NPCs, have skills, personalities, goals, and desires of
their own. You may give them orders, and they will
follow them to the best of their ability. If the GM
deems the order to be too risky to the devotees life or
wellbeing, you may have to pass one or more
persuasion checks to convince them to perform the
task.

## Scale

There are two different scales that Heart Rush is
played at. The first is the moment-to-moment scale,
called micro-scale. This is the scale that combat and
conversations usually play out at. When a player
says what they want to do with their action in
combat, or describes or RPs the things they say to
another character, this is micro-scale.
The second scale is the macro-scale—when
actions are described more generically, and the
details don’t really matter. For example, when the
players say that they spend the rest of the night
hanging out with people from the inn, or when a
player says they want to spend the day hunting deer,
this is macro-scale.
The first half of this book describes how to
handle the micro-scale. Things you do either
succeed, or they fail, and there are strict definitions
for the outcomes of different activities you take.
Macro-scale is more nuanced and does not have the
same sort of strict rules for outcomes. In this section,
handling the macro-scale is described.

Macro-Scale

For the most part, macro-scale activities should
play out in whatever way makes the most sense and
would feel natural. However, when the macro-scale
action is one that has a specific goal and is risky or
has potential to fail, then you must use these rules.
Note that many times, activities that are risky or
have potential to fail are better suited to being played
out at micro-scale. For example, a conversation with
a duke to persuade him of new policy _could_ be
played out at macro-scale, if players would rather not
deal with the details of the conversation. However,

```
players may prefer to handle the situation themselves
on a more granular scale, in which case the
conversation should happen on a micro-scale. If
you're sure the activity should happen on a macro-
scale and the outcome is uncertain, proceed.
```

```
Running the Skill Check
Make sure players everyone is aware of what the
goal is, and make sure it's clear what a success state
looks like. This doesn't have to happen explicitly, but
it's usually safer to say it directly. If players are
going to fight off some thugs, and their goal is to
“win”, for example, this is not a clearly defined
success state. What does winning look like? Dead
thugs? Thugs that ran off? Thugs that are scared of
the players? Thugs that ran off and are scared of the
players? And does it matter if there are witnesses?
Once the success state is defined, you as the GM
should set and inform the players of the CN for the
roll. Then, the player can make a normal skill check
against the CN.
If the players roll 2 greater than the CN, then
they should be awarded a full success. If the players
roll somewhere between CN + 2 and CN - 2, the
players should get a partial success. And if the
players roll less, then it should result in failure. How
to run each of those outcomes is detailed below.
```

```
Full Success
When players achieve full success, they should
be able to achieve their goal, or at least have very
little work left to get there. Before or after this
moment of success, zoom in on a side effect from the
list below. Be specific.
```

Success, and

- you find something else useful or interesting
- you meet someone unusual or who might be
  helpful later
- you discover a secret
- you gain a valuable ally
- you find unexpected rewards or resources

Examples

- **The player is foraging to get food** : “An hour
  walk around the lake reveals little signs of food.
  However, as you near your starting location, you
  spot a small dark spot at the top of a nearby tree.
  Upon approach, it appears to be a cache of food.”
  When players investigate further, they also
  discover a crude map and some tools (unexpected
  rewards or resources).
- **The player is doing daily musical
  performances to make money** : “Your music is
  enormously popular in the city. Crowds gather, and
  you’re making about X (decide for yourself) ducat
  every day. After one, particularly impressive
  performance, a woman approaches you. She wears
  fine furs and her wrists and neck are dripping with
  silver and gold.” Upon conversation, the woman
  reveals herself to be someone looking for a
  musician for her upcoming, private party (unusual
  person/valuable ally).
- **The player is visiting all the pubs, looking
  for blackmail on the king** : “You hit a dozen pubs,
  being careful to ask the right questions so as to not
  raise too much suspicion. First, you learn that
  [insert blackmail about the king]. Second, you also
  noticed that one of the pubs you visited had a
  strangely high number of people who entered, and
  appeared to disappear inside. However, according
  to the owner there were many empty rooms.
  Wherever those people had gone, it wasn’t to their

```
rooms.” The location is a secret meeting place for a
covert faction (find something else interesting).
```

```
Par t i al S u cc e s s
On a partial success, the original goal should still
be achievable, but there should be some final
obstacle or cost in the way. Before the player
achieves their desired goal, zoom in. Present the
options and outline the consequences.
```

```
Success, but
```

- it has a cost
- it requires getting into a situation
- it’s a worse version
- you disturb the status quo
- you will attract unwanted attention or suspicion
- people aren’t happy about it
- there will be consequences
- it will cost a favor
- it will cost a relationship
- it’s incomplete, or mixed with misdirection

```
Examples
```

- **The player is selling their goods in a new
  city to make money** : “You spend the day talking
  to vendors, looking for someone interested in
  buying your wares. As the day nears an end, you
  finally find someone who’s intrigued. He’s a
  peculiar looking fellow, with a brimmed hat, a long
  coat, and a pipe. You had been chatting with a
  representative at the guild and he had been
  listening from a seat nearby, and approaches you as
  you come out. ‘How do you do,’ he says, stepping
  up to shake your hand.” The man is willing to buy
  your wares, but he wants your help making amends
  with another merchant he burned his relationship
  with (it has a cost).
- **The player is navigating a passage through
  the mountains** : “The trip is slow but you’re

```
relatively confident that you know where you are.
However, around noon you come to a steep valley.
You don’t recognize this on your map, but you can
clearly see the lake you are trying to reach, only a
couple miles beyond. On either side of the valley,
you see burrows dotting the ground, each about 3
feet across. From where you stand at the foot of the
valley, however, all appears to be still.” Dangerous
creatures may emerge from the burrows if the
players travel through the valley (you will attract
unwanted attention or suspicion/it requires getting
into a situation).
```

- **The player is mentoring a student to teach
  them how to run the ship in their absence** : “The
  months stretch on, and Björn appears to be
  learning well. However, Björn is not popular with
  the crew. They think he’s a bit weak, and hasn't
  really proven his meddle, so they don’t want to be
  reporting to him in your absence.” Players may
  have to seek out a dangerous situation so that
  Björn can prove himself, or deal with later
  consequences of having an unpopular leader for
  their crew (people aren't happy about it).

Failure

On a failure, the original goal was failed.
However, there must always be some degree of
progression to throw the ball back in players’ court.
Describe the failure, and then zoom in on the silver
lining.

Failure, but

- you find something else useful or interesting
- you meet someone unusual or who might be
  helpful later
- you discover a secret
- you get clues towards where you can try again
- you gain a better understanding of the situation

```
Examples
```

- **The player is recruiting villagers to defend
  the settlement** : “Going from door to door, you beg
  the townsfolk to assemble—it’s their village they
  need to defend! However, your pleas are largely
  ignored, and except for a small ragtag group of
  idiots and misfits, nobody seems particularly
  interested in doing anything to stop the invaders.
  ‘New nobility, same taxes’ they say. However,
  while scouring the area for homes, you eventually
  spot a small shack on the hill. It is the last home
  around.” Inside is a crazy old man with insight on
  the nature of the attackers and maybe has ideas on
  defending the village (find someone unusual, better
  understanding of the situation).
- **The players are beating up a pickpocket to
  teach them a lesson** : “You grab the pickpocket by
  the back of the collar, and yank him back. With a
  yelp, the pickpocket wriggles free, sliding their
  shirt off and sprinting down the street before you
  can grab them again. You are left only with the
  pickpocket’s shirt. However, before you throw it
  away, you notice a small insignia of a leaping tiger
  embroidered in with gold thread, with the letters S
  V L underneath it.” This is the icon and insignia of
  the queen’s secret service of city spies (find
  something else useful/interesting, discover a
  secret).
- **The player is trying to learn new spells at
  an academy for elemental mages** : “A few months
  pass, and you are really struggling to pick up any
  of it. It’s mainly due to the fact that the professor
  for the class rarely shows up, and when she does,
  seems incredibly exhausted. One evening, while

Complication Triggered:

- A new danger is revealed

- People aren’t happy about it

## Creating a Monster

RPGs are great when played by the seat of your
pants. Unfortunately, Heart Rush is a fairly tactical
game that requires some degree of preparation for
combat. On the bright side, even a boring monster
can be exciting to fight in Heart Rush, and if you
want to make the monster more interesting it is not
difficult.

Base Stats

If you are creating a monster, you will absolutely
need to know each of the following stats:

- HP
- Heart die
- Might, agility, and cunning dice
- Weapon die
- Armor
  It doesn't really matter what you assign to these
  values—you just want them to be “realistic-ish”.
  Bear in mind that a player starts with 40 HP, a d8
  heart die, d6-ish ability dice, and a d10-ish weapon,
  and maybe 2-6 armor. Use that as a metric to build
  your monster, and scale the values up or down.

Bells and Whistles

If you have all of the above, you’ve got a
standard monster, and it's good enough to use in a
fight. If you want the monster to have more flavor,
it’s a good idea to add abilities. Monsters don’t need
to have lots of abilities, they just need ones that ooze
with the flavor of that monster. A basilisk needs an
ability that paralyzes people. A cobra needs to be
able to poison people. A fire dragon needs to be able
to breathe fire on people.

```
Ability Templates
If you don't want to come up with your own
ability from scratch, use an ability template from the
list below.
```

- **Aura** : At the beginning of each creature’s turn
  within X feet...
- **Attack Side Effect** : When this creature
  directly beats a stance...
- **AoE** : As priority ability, everyone within
  [area]...
- **Damage Side Effect** : When this creature deals
  damage...
- **Non-Weapon Attack** : Target creature/s make a
  [ability] saving throw. On a failure, those
  creatures... On a success...

```
Ability Effects
Here are some common effects for monster
abilities to spark your imagination.
```

- Conditions
  - Weakened/Off-balanced/Dazed
  - Poisoned
  - Prone
  - Grappled
  - Restrained
  - Blinded
  - Stunned
  - Slowed
  - Burning
- Forced movement
- Additional damage

Wilderness Travel

When traveling long distances where the travel
itself is dangerous and a point of adventure, special
rules go into effect. In this mode of gameplay, time
progresses in blocks of time, split into the four
quarters of the day: morning, afternoon, evening, and
night. Each quarter can be spent traveling or
camping.
While traveling, you are moving towards your
destination. For each quarter of the day you spend
traveling, you cover a number of miles equal to half
of your travel speed. Additionally, for each quarter
spent traveling, you may take one action with the
_travel_ tag from the Journey Actions section below.
While camping, you are recovering from your
travels and preparing for the next leg of the journey.

```
For each quarter spent camping, you may take one
action with the camp tag from the Journey Actions
section below.
```

```
Journey Actions
While traveling, you can take one journey action
for each quarter of the day, so long as its tag
corresponds to what you're doing during that quarter.
Some journey actions have both a travel and a camp
tag, meaning you can always take the action. All
players should determine which journey action they
want to take before they are resolved.
Most actions require you to make a skill check
agains the environment. Below is a chart defining the
challenge numbers for different journey actions in
different environments. The GM may adjust these
CNs based on additional factors.
```

When you take a journey action at night, it's
substantially harder to do it effectively. Any skill
checks made for a journey action taken during the
night quarter have D2. If you are traveling during the
night, you travel half as far.
The journey actions are listed below:

```
Captain
Travel.
You manage and steer your vehicle. If you are on
a vehicle, someone on the vehicle must take this
action. Make a CN 8 skill check relevant to piloting

your vehicle. On a failure, you travel half as far this
quarter.
Only one person can take this action each
quarter.

Entertain

_Travel. Camp._
You keep morale up, by singing, sharing stories,
or entertaining in some other way. Make a CN 8
entertainment skill check. On a success, grant
someone else a destiny point. If you beat the CN by
four points or more, grant two DP instead.

Fish

_Camp._
You go fishing. You must have fishing gear and
be near a body of water to take this action.
Make a fishing skill check against the challenge
number for the environment. On a success, you catch
two rations worth of food. For every point over the
CN, you catch two additional rations worth of food.

Forage
_Travel. Camp._
You look for edible plants, roots, and berries.
Make a foraging skill check against the challenge
number for the environment. If you use this as a
travel action, you have disadvantage on this roll. On
a success, you find six rations. For every point over
the CN, you find one additional ration worth of food.

Gather Wood
_Camp._

You look for dry wood or other flammables to
build a fire. Make a search skill check against the
challenge number for the environment. On a success,
you gather one bundle of wood (enough to keep a
small fire burning for a quarter). If you beat the CN
by four or more, you gather two bundles of wood

```
(enough to keep a large fire burning for one quarter,
or a small fire burning for two quarters).
```

```
Hunt
Travel. Camp.
You track down and kill a wild animal for food.
You must have a light or heavy ranged weapon with
a range of 30 feet or greater to take this action.
Make a tracking skill check against the
challenge number for the environment. If you use
this as a travel action, you have disadvantage on this
roll. On a success, you find a prey animal worth 2
rations of food, typical to the surrounding terrain, if
any exist. If you beat the CN by four or more, the
animal you find is worth 20 rations instead. You may
then make a hunting skill check against the challenge
number for the environment. On a success, you kill
the animal before it gets away.
```

```
Lo o k o u t
Travel. Camp.
You keep watch while moving, or explore the
surroundings around your camp. Make a perception
skill check against the challenge number for your
environment. On a success, you see or hear any
threats as soon as they become visible or audible. If
you beat the CN by four points or more, you spot
something interesting while searching, as determined
by the GM.
```

```
Navigate
Travel. Camp.
You use charts and your surroundings to keep
track of where you are. If someone does not take this
action while in a travel phase, you may become lost
at the GM’s discretion.
When you take this action, make a navigation
check against the challenge number for the
environment. On a failure, you are lost. Add an
additional event to the journey. The GM should roll
```

on the _Lost in the Wilderness_ table to determine the
outcome.

Scou t A he ad
_Travel._
If scouting ahead is feasible, you may take this
action. Make a scouting skill check against the
environment's challenge number. On a success,
choose one of the following journey actions:
Captain, Fish, Gather Wood, Forage, Hunt, Make
Camp, or Navigate. During the next quarter, skill
checks made for the chosen journey action have
advantage.

Sleep
_Camp. Travel\*._
When you take this action, you may take a long
rest. Make your sleeping check. If you take this
action during a quarter of the day other than the
night, you have -20 on this roll.
You can sleep while traveling if you are not on
foot. You have -30 to the sleeping check.

Interruptions in the Journey

If you get into a fight, explore something you
discovered, or take part in any lengthy activity that
the GM rules is not part of the journey, the journey
actions pause. When they resume, the GM may start
at whatever quarter they deem appropriate.

Getting Lost

When you are lost, rather than going in the
intended direction, you cover the same distance in a
cardinal direction determined by 1d4 (1: North, 2:
East, 3: South, 4: West). So long as you are lost,
quarters spent traveling continue to be in random
directions.
You remain lost until you succeed at a _navigate_
journey action.

Carrying Gear

```
When you travel, you will likely want to bring
your gear. These rules break down how much gear
you can carry and what happens when you try to
carry more.
```

```
Encumbrance Score
There are several critical points of burden. Your
first critical point of carrying capacity is your
encumbrance score. This is equal to half of your
might die times 10, and it dictates how many pounds
of gear you can carry without any penalty.
Once you surpass that amount, however, you
become encumbered. While encumbered, for every
10 pounds over your encumbrance threshold,
rounded up, your movement speed is reduced by 5
feet.
```

```
Maximum Carrying Capacity
Your second critical point of burden is your
maximum carrying capacity, equal to your might die
times 10. Although you can lift more than this, you
cannot carry this much for a full quarter of the day.
```

```
Pac k A n i m al s & Vehicles
Rather than carrying all of your gear on your
back, using a pack animal or vehicle can help. Use
the following chart to determine the carrying
capacity. If you are riding the animal, remember to
subtract your own weight as well.
Carrying Capacity
Animal/Vehicle Capacity
Donkey 150
Horse 300

```

- Navigation. Using skills and potentially
  navigation tools to stay on course towards your
  destination.
- Gathering Food. Either hunting, fishing, or
  foraging for food.
- Gathering Firewood. Finding wood to burn to
  cook food and stay warm.
- Finding Shelter. Finding viable places to sleep
  during the night.
  Unless otherwise noted by the GM, each of these
  activities should be performed each day of travel.

Piloting

Roll a piloting skill check against the
environment challenge number. On a failure, you
cover half as much distance this day.

Navigate

Roll a navigation skill check against the
environment challenge number. On a failure, you get
lost. While lost, you make no progress towards your
destination. The GM may roll on the _Lost in the
Wilderness_ table.

Gather Food

Whoever makes this check should decide if they
are hunting, fishing, or foraging. They should then

```
make the respective skill check against the
environment challenge number.
Hunting. You must have an appropriate weapon
to use this option. On a success, roll 1d6. On a 1–4,
you get enough rations for the party for a day. On a 5
you get enough rations for two days. On a 6, you get
enough rations for four days. If you do not build a
fire, these rations are inedible.
Fishing. You must have fishing line and hooks to
use this option. On a success, you get enough rations
for the party for one day. For every three points you
beat the CN by, you catch another day worth of
rations. If you do not build a fire, these rations are
inedible.
Foraging. On a success, you get enough rations
for the party for one day. If you beat the CN by four
points or more, you also find ingredients to make a
basic healing kit.
On a failure to gather food, the party may have to
hunt more dangerous creatures, eat unidentified
plants, eat a pack animal, or go hungry. It is up to the
GM to determine which options are available
(including any additional, unlisted ones).
```

```
Gathering Firewood
Roll a skill check to find firewood against the
environment challenge number. On a success, you
gather enough firewood to cook fish or game for
rations and to raise the temperature of wherever
people are sleeping by one tier for the night. If you
beat the CN by four points or more, you gather
enough wood for a second day as well. On a failure,
you must either burn gear or go without a fire for the
night.
```

```
Shelter
Roll a skill check to find a suitable spot for
shelter against the environment challenge number.
On a success, you find a suitable place for the party
to spend the night. On a failure, the party gets -10 on
```

```
Lo s t i n t h e W i l d e r n e s s
Result Effect
1–3 The party ends up in a dangerous
location. There could be environmental
hazards here, dangerous animals, a rival
faction, a magical curse, or anything else.
4-5 There’s no available water to be found.
6 There is no safe shelter to be found.
```

```
The GM should roll 1d6 to determine the effect of getting lost. If the
result is unrealistic, re-roll on the table.
```

the sleeping check for each point you missed the CN
by.

Scou t A he ad (Av a i l a b l e O n l y a s Ta l e n t?)

Roll at beginning of day. Increases odds of
success on any of the other rolls.

Feedback:

"During each day of the journey": I'd consider
this section in need of both a rewrite for clarity(I'm
assuming you mean the GM declares which actions
are selectible, e.g. travling on foot has no need for
piloting, traveling on a river means little need for
navigation uness there's a fork, etc.) and I'd have a
few issues with the restrictions as well. E.g. if the
party has 5 wood, I'd want to double up on campsite
or hunting). You might also want to have a "do
nothing/rest option" e.g. Fergus the Fighter got cut
up badly in that last fight, maybe he just sleeps a bit.
Or Maggie the Mage lets others do menial tasks to
meditate nd recover mana instead (to the party's
chargrin perhaps).
Captaining/piloting: On occassion you could also
have an additionl challenge to avoid damaging the
vehicle over tricky terrain, weather, etc.

- Have an encounter system, where there are
  guaranteed to be X number of situations the
  players end up in
- Break the trip into phases, and have one of
  these rolls per phase?
- Can someone do all actions? Double up on
  some? Penalties for doing so?
- Prior preparations
- Fast vs slow movement
  - Fast: no gathering resources
  - Slow: no surprises
- Scouting (bonus for slow)

```
New system:
```

```
Travel scenarios:
```

- Players travel the sea, going to a distant
  archipelago
- They wreck their ship after getting lost
- They encounter a sea monster.
- They almost die from starvation.
- Players cross stormy mountains - Snowed in, can’t move for ages. - Attacked by large animals - Can’t find firewood, almost freeze - Run out of food, starve or eat animals - Get lost, find themselves in dangerous
  area
- Players venture to the center of a barren desert - Struggle to stay cool in hottest weather.
  Forced to stop in shade in dangerous area.
- Can’t find any food to hunt

```
Getting lost means more events
```

```
First determine if you are packing food before
you go, or getting it as you travel. If you pack before
you go, you need 4 pounds of carrying capacity, per
person, per day.
```

```
During trip:
```

- Meet a stranger
- Find resources (food, magical goods,
  abandoned equipment, survival). They might not
  be easily accessible.
- An obstacle in the journey. Cliffs, wide river,
  fire swamps, etc.
- Encounter hostile individuals or faction.
  Could be people who know the players, robbers,
  or a dangerous tribe

- A scene of horror: Cursed location, creepy
  animals, creepy threats, creepy sounds. Take
  fantasy location and make it disturbing
- A request for Aid. A person or people need
  assistance
- Point of Interest: Some location or relic of a
  past culture
- Environmental or weather hazard that makes
  it impossible to find shelter, or impossible to stay
  warm or cool.
- Natural wonder
- Monster hunt: hunt or be hunted
- Deadly fight

No shelter: It’s evening, and there’s no shelter
from the elements to be found. Night is falling, and
perhaps the temperature too. If you don’t sleep for a
night, take another travel phase after this one. Each
roll has disadvantage.
GM should present players with a tough choice.
Stay up all night and take a penalty, or navigate in
the dark.

Failed watch: if the event is other NPCs or
monsters, they surprise you before you see them
Failed navigation: You lose substantial time

If players are traveling with their own food, it’s 5
pounds of food per person per day. While you have
food, you don’t need to make Gather Food check
while traveling.
If traveling with a tent (30 pounds), you have
advantage on the finding shelter check.

Adventuring Gear

While adventuring, you will want to bring gear.
Check out the Carrying Your Gear section for rules
about slots and encumbrance.
Some of the gear in the table below have limited
uses, denoted by the _dX uses_ in the _Notes_ column. If

```
something has dX uses, then you should roll an X-
sided die. If the result is a 1, then the die decreases in
size. If that would cause the die to decrease to less
than a d2, then instead, the item is used up.

## Appendix B

Besides knowing the rules, there are some ways
to be a good Heart Rush player. This includes advice
for how to play this game compared to other RPGs.

Building a Char acter

When you create your character, it can be helpful
to think about certain questions. Doing so will help
you have a better grasp who you are playing, and
will enable you to have more fun playing as that
character. It’s a good idea to have some answers to
the following questions, but you can also feel free to
skip this step.

What Will You Be Known for?

This one is perhaps the most important. As
important as knowing who you are now, it is also
important to know who you will become. What do

```
you want to do with your life? How will you be
remembered?
```

```
What Do You Care About?
You need to know what matters to your character.
Do you have strong beliefs about something? What
are those beliefs? With strong beliefs, you are more
likely to have reasons to interact with the story, so it
is good to have some.
```

```
What Were You Doing Before?
You don’t need a full life story, but it’s a good
idea to have some idea of what you were doing
before the story begins. What were you doing
yesterday? How about last week? Last month? Last
year? Five years ago? The answers don’t need to be
precise, but with more details, the GM has more
material to work with for creating an immersive
story.
```

## Appendix C: Magic Items

A collection of examples of various magical
items.

Wan d of F i r e b al l s
_Level 5. Fiery._
A great ball of fire erupts from the wand. Choose
a point within 90 feet. Every creature within 15 feet
of that point must make an agility saving throw. On
failure, a creature takes 5 levels of burning. On
success, the creature only takes three levels instead.

Sandals of Levitation
_Level 3. Aerial._

These shoes allow the wearer to levitate for brief
periods of time. As an action, you may choose to
activate them. For the next minute, you levitate one
foot of the ground. You gain a fly speed of 15 feet.

## Fix List

- Statting up enemies should be _effortless_. I
  want to be able to not prep enemies at all, just
  describe them, their relative difficulty to the
  players, and run them
- Tracking money
- Tracking research
- Travel talents
- Weather effects

```
Food
```

- Finding food - Hunting - Fishing - Foraging
  Water
- Finding water
  Shelter
- Finding/building shelter if no tent
  Warmth
- Gather wood
- Building shelter
  Navigation

```
Situations that warrant using rules:
```

- Mountains
- Canyons
- Swamp

Odds of no hunting
Odds of no foraging
Odds of not finding water
Odds of not finding wood for a fire (you don't get
rations from hunting, and no warmth).
Odds of getting lost

```
Odds of not finding a place for shelter in the
evening
```

## OSR PbtA

```
Gritty, simulationist PbtA.
```

Are rules necessary? Simulate factions. Skills,
professions. Roll. Complications, bonuses.

Do players get to say what happens when they do
things? no.
Granularity of conversation, easily scalable up
and down.
Monsters are just a description, and a number to
represent their power in relation to the players.

- This giant spider is a “boss-level” threat.
  Therefore +2. (+3 for nearly lethal, +1 for nasty).
  It’s got the traits: “shoots web to ensnare
  enemies”, “venomous fangs”, and “climbs on
  walls and ceiling” (totally optional to write
  down) - As a +2 boss, numbers to beat are
  +2. Partial success, failure, etc.

```
Best of all worlds:
```

- GM Moves
- Aspects
- Enemies have difficulty which is just mod
  from basic values. Traits describe how the enemy
  behaves. Motivation/goals so you know how to
  run it.
- Professions as skills.
- Partial success mechanics
- Let players decide what they want to do. By
  attempting to do those things and failing,
  complications occur.

## Special Thanks

Jess

The first person to see all the drivel that gets
spewed onto these pages. Full of wisdom and
sardonic humor, and has been the best wall I’ve ever
had the honor to bounce ideas off of for Heart Rush.

Soren

You have suffered through countless reworks of
characters where I have been forced to change rules
to mitigate your inventive builds. You have been the
excel-spreadsheet-guru-master-of-balance. You even
play tested the game and ran it as a GM once early
on—a formidable task, considering the state of the
rules at the time. Any single one of those roles is
enough to warrant significant thanks. You have been
invaluable to this project, and without your help, I
doubt Heart Rush would be here today.

Jakob

You have been a constant source of hype,
excitement, and constructive feedback for Heart
Rush. You stuck through it as I put you through some
pretty terrible iterations of RPG game design, and
not only that, but helped me figure out exactly what
worked, and what didn’t. Your encouragement
helped me carry through.

Carl

Whether you intended to or not, talking to you
about Heart Rush and hearing you get excited about
how you’re going to beat face with new talent-
synergies has never ceased to inspire me to work
harder and better. It’s a pleasure to write mechanics

```
for someone who so thoroughly enjoys using them.
And the dice script! Making that was fun.
```

```
All of the Carleton Nerds
Having a constant group of friends who were
always down to play test whatever new shenanigans
I had cooked up is a rare treat. The rules changed
over and over—even on the fly, and I would (and
still do) forget how mechanics worked mid-game.
Those are both things many groups would never be
willing to put up with. But you guys did, and for
that, I am grateful.
```

```
@Game-Design-Consultancy-Group on
Discord
When I had a new idea, and didn’t know what to
do with it, you all were there to help me figure it out.
You offered your insights, thoughts, and feedback,
and I loved all of it. It solved a lot of questions for
me. Thank you.
```

```
California Nerds
That’s right—I didn’t forget about you guys
either. That was a lot of game time we fit into just a
few months, and it was epic. I’m sure it helped me
develop HR a bit, but most of all, it was a
phenomenally fun time. I miss you guys.
