# # Kethic Elementalism

Kethic elementalism, also known as Kethic and
elemental magic, is one of the most prevalent
systems of magic. Its basis is in one of attunement.
By understanding a fundamental element completely,
and having a primal bond with that thing, one can
develop power to control that element. As that bond
and understanding grows, one’s power over that
element grows.
There are nine fundamental elements: earth, air,
fire, water, light, dark, force, time, and void. With
these elements, nearly everything is created.
By attuning to different elements, you have some
basic power over those elements. There are three
different levels of attunement for each element—
each of which grant you increasing abilities.
However, attuning to an element is difficult.
Most people never attune to any elements in their life
times, and your spirit must be able to handle the
additional pressure of resonating with the your
attuned element. Those who do will frequently do so
by accident after an unusual or extreme exposure to
one of these such elements. More advanced
attunements require even more exposure, and
paragon level attunements generally require special
activity dedicated to developing an attunement to
that element.
Kethic also comes with limitations. Every living
thing has some very low level attunement with all
the elements, and for this reason, it is nearly
impossible for another creature to interfere with
elements especially close to another living being,
such as its blood or flesh.

Resonate

Substances

```
One of the primary forms of elemental
manipulation is through attunement to resonate
substances. These are the collection of materials that
you have control over. Different types of substances
have different rules dictating your affinity to them at
different levels, however. For example, a master of
earth still won't be able to create as much stone as an
equally skilled master of air can create breathable air
—the solid stone is just fundamentally more difficult
to work with.
The limitations to your control over different
types of substances is listed in the following
sections. There are three different categories of
substances: solids, liquids, and gasses.
```

Solids

```
Manipulation
You can physically manipulate the shape and
form of the substance with your hands as though it
was clay. It is about as fast as literally shaping
something out of clay.
Advanced Attunement
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 15 feet. You do not have to
physically touch the material to shape it. Even
though your hands are not touching the material,
```

their movements control the manipulation as though
the solid was in your hands.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 45 feet.

Sensing

You can sense the direction and approximate
shape and size of the substance within 15 feet, even
if you can’t see them. Your approximations are in 5-
foot cube increments.

Advanced Attunement
The range of your sensing increases to 45 feet.
For substances that you can hold in your hands, you
can sense precise details as though your were
looking through it.

```
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your sensing increases to 120 feet.
```

Creation & Destruction

As an action, you can create or destroy up to a 1-
foot cube of the substance in your hands. If digging a
passage way in this way, you can burrow a humanoid
sized hole a rate of 1 foot per minute. When creating
this solid, it is created in shapeless, 1-foot cubes, and
require further action to shape them further.

Advanced Attunement
You can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in
your hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of
2 feet per minute.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
You can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in
your hands as an action. You may burrow at a rate of
5 feet per minute.

```
Manipulation
As an action, you can crudely manipulate the
flow of the substance in a 15 foot range around you,
such as creating eddies or a current in one direction
or another. Currents you create can be up to 2 miles
per hour. Additionally, you can hold up to a 1-foot
cube of it in your hands without a container.
Advanced Attunement
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 45 feet. You can cause currents of
up to 4 miles per hour.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 120 feet. You can cause currents of
up to 6 miles per hour.
```

```
Movement
While in this substance, your swim speed is
increased by 10 feet.
Advanced Attunement
While in this substance, your swim speed is
increased by 20 feet. Additionally, you can walk on
this substance.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
While in this substance, your swim speed is
increased by 40 feet.
```

```
Sensing
You can sense the direction of the substance
within 120 feet, even if you can’t see it. Your
approximations are in 20-foot cube increments.
Advanced Attunement
The range of your sensing increases to 300 feet.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your sensing increases to 900 feet.
