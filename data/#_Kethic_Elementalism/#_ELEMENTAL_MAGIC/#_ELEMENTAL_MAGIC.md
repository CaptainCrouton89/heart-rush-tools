## # ELEMENTAL MAGIC

Creation & Destruction

You can create or destroy up to a 1-foot cube of
the substance in your hands as an action.

Advanced Attunement
You can create or destroy up to a 1.5-foot cube in
your hands as an action.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
You can create or destroy up to a 2-foot cube in
your hands as an action.

Gasses

Manipulation

As an action, you can crudely manipulate the
flow of the substance in a 15 foot range around you,
such as creating eddies or a current in one direction
or another. Currents you create can be up to 10 miles
per hour.

Advanced Attunement
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 45 feet. You can cause air speeds
up to 20 miles per hour.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your manipulation increases to
substances within 120 feet. You can cause air speeds
up to 40 miles per hour.

Movement

While in this substance, you fall at a rate of 50
feet per round, and may travel 5 feet for every 5 feet
you fall, up to 30 feet of lateral movement. You take
half fall-damage if you fall through this substance.
You can jump up to 10 feet in the air while in this
substance, and over creatures size medium and
smaller.

Advanced Attunement
While in this substance, you fall at a rate of 25
feet per round, and may travel 10 feet for every 5

```
feet you fall, up to 60 feet of lateral movement. You
take no fall damage from falling.
You can jump up to 15 feet in the air while in this
substance, and over creatures size large and smaller.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
You gain a fly speed of 30 feet (affected by
armor and other movement penalties as well). You
ascend at half speed.
```

```
Sensing
You can sense the direction of the substance
within 120 feet, even if you can’t see it. Your
approximations are in 20-foot cube increments.
Advanced Attunement
The range of your sensing increases to 300 feet.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
The range of your sensing increases to 900 feet.
```

```
Creation & Destruction
You can cause this substance to slowly appear or
disappear from around you as an action. If this
substance causes a condition such as blindness or
suffocation, it can be produced at a maximum of a
single level. You can produce a 5-foot cube once
each round as an action, and in no more than a 5-foot
radius from you. You cannot create or destroy in air-
tight locations, including within liquids. Gasses
dissipate after a minute, or immediately if blown
away with a breeze.
Advanced Attunement
You can create or destroy up to a 10-foot cube as
an action instead, and in a 15 foot radius.
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
You can create or destroy up to a 15-foot cube as
an action instead, and in a 45 foot radius.
```

Converting Between

Substances

Sometimes, you will be able to convert between
different types of substances, such as with ice and
water, or lava and stone. These conversions use the
following rules.
Conversions happen at a rate equal to twice the
creation rate of whatever substance you are turning it
into, and at a range equal to the corresponding
manipulation range.
For example, with an advanced attunement to a
solid, you can create a 1.5-foot cube as an action. If
you are instead turning a liquid into a solid, you can
create a 2-foot cube of solid as an action, and you
can do it at a range of 15 feet.
If you instead were converting that solid into a
liquid at an advanced level, you would have the
same increase in volume, but would instead be able
to do it at a range of 45 feet, since that is the
advanced liquid manipulation range.

Tr a pp i n g a C r e a t u r e

If you try to convert the substance a creature is
standing in into a solid, it is usually slow enough that
the creature can escape becoming trapped, unless it
already cannot move.

The Ele me n t s

There are nine different elements—fire, air,
water, earth, light, dark, force, void, and time. When
you have a level of attunement with an element, you
gain all of its benefits, as well as the benefits from
every level before it. Gaining attunements to
elements is also one of the primary ways to gain
attunements to resonate substances. You can gain an

talent, found in the Talents section.

Fire

```
Basic Attunement
```

- As an action, you can ignite or put out small
  flames within 5 feet without touching them.
- You can sense any fire within 45 feet,
  including how much, its general direction, and
  intensity.
- You take half damage from the burning
  condition.

```
Advanced Attunement
```

- Add ash to your resonate substances as a basic,
  solid attunement.
- Add smoke to your resonate substances as a
  basic, gaseous substance attunement. Smoke blinds
  and suffocates those who stand in it.
- As an action, you can ignite or put out
  flammable items within 45 feet.
- You can sense fire within a 300 feet, including
  how much, its general direction, and intensity.
- You are immune to the burning condition.

```
Par ag on At t u n e m e n t
```

- Add lava rocks, such as pumice and obsidian to
  your resonate substances at basic, solid substance
  attunements.
- Your attunements to ash and smoke become
  advanced.
- As an action, you can ignite or put out
  flammable items within 120 feet.
- As an action, you can manipulate all fire and
  smoke within 120 feet into shapes, patterns, and
  different colors.
