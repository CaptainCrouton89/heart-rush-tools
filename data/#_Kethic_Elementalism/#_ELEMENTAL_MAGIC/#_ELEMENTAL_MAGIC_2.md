## # ELEMENTAL MAGIC

```
A Note on Light and Dark
It’s hard to actually “hurt” someone with
light or darkness. Many of the other elements
have physical aspects or obvious connections to
sources of damage, but light and dark do not.
You’ll notice in the spell sections that spells
with the light and dark tags only deal damage
when they’re paired with another element.
```

Advanced Attunement

- The range of your darkvision increases by 30
  feet.
- The range at which you can create darkness
  increases by 30 feet.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t

- Other creatures with darkvision cannot see
  through darkness you create.
- The range at which you can create darkness
  increases by 60 feet.

Force

Basic Attunement

- As an action, you can apply up to 10 pounds of
  force to any non-living object within 90 feet. You
  can manipulate fine objects, so long as they only
  require one, linear force applied to them.

Advanced Attunement

- The force you can apply increases to a
  maximum of 20 pounds.
- You may divide this force between up to three
  different objects.
- You can manipulate fine objects that would not
  otherwise require a skill check to manipulate, and
  can apply rotational force.

Par ag on At t u n e m e n t

- You may divide this force between any number
  of different objects.
- You may manipulate objects that would require
  a skill check to use. You cannot wield a weapon
  using this force.

Spellcasting

Gaining Spells

Learning a spell represents mastery over some
aspect of one’s connection with an element, allowing
the user to perform some fantastical feat. Anyone
with an attunement can learn to cast a spell.
By spending XP, as described in the Gaining and
Spending XP section, one can gain a new spell,
chosen from the list of spells in the Spells section.
You must have at least a basic attunement to all of
the elements in the tags listed below each spell in
order to learn that spell.

Casting Spells

Casting a spell is more difficult than simple
elemental manipulation performed with just an
attunement, as it requires more precise control for a
longer duration. Performing a powerful act of
elemental control while in the thick of a fight takes
skill and practice, and comes with the following
restrictions:

- Casting a spell requires your action.
- You may cast only one spell per round.
- Casting a spell requires at least one free hand
- If casting a spell, you cannot have moved more
  than half your movement speed (after accounting
  for armor and other penalties), rounded up.
- After casting the spell, you cannot move more
  than half your movement speed (after accounting
  for armor and other penalties).
  Casting spells is strenuous, and takes a toll on
  your body, and without proper preparation, can
  wreak havoc on your ability to channel your
  attunement in that way again for a while. You must
  wait four long rests before casting that spell again,
  though that time may vary as per the following rules:
- Subtract one long rest for each consecutive
  round taken before this action spent unmoving,
  taking no actions and using no abilities, and not
  communicating (in complete, meditative
  concentration).
- Subtract one long rest if you have an advanced
  attunement with the elemental type of the spell you
  are casting.
- Subtract two long rests if you instead have a
  paragon attunement with the elemental type of the
  spell you are casting.
  If the total number of long rests would be
  reduced to zero, you must still wait at least one short
  rest before casting the spell again.

```
Spellcasting Ability
Whenever a creature has to make a saving throw
against your spellcasting ability, it must make a
check against the maximum of your current heart
die, plus two times your paragon level.

Spells

```
Spells are listed by their name, along with two
tags—their required attunements, and if they are
ongoing or immediate. Most spells have only a
single attunement as prerequisite for casting the
spell, but some have two or more. If the spell is
immediate, the spell effect occurs once when the
spell is cast. If the spell is ongoing, the spell’s effects
continue for up to one minute, or when the spell
caster chooses to end the spell as an instant ability.
