## # SPELLS

Oil Slick
_Water and Earth. Ongoing._
You cause a pool of slippery oil to expand over
an area, making it impossible to safely walk on.
Choose a point within 45 feet. All space within 15
feet of that point is slippery, and any creature that
moves more than five feet through the space or
makes an A/D roll in that space must make an agility
saving throw contested by your spellcasting ability.
If the creature fails, it falls prone. If it was making an
A/D roll, treat the result of their roll, before applying
modifiers, as a zero.

One With the Shadows
_Dark. Ongoing._
You close your hand into a fist, drawing the
darkness around you. If you are in dim light or
darkness, you turn invisible. If you enter bright light,
cast a spell, or attack, you become visible once more.

Pillars of Ice
_Water. Ongoing._
You raise an open, grasping hand to the air,
raising huge icicles forth from the ground, each
radiating a chilling aura. Choose three unoccupied
spaces within 45 feet. In each space, a 10-foot pillar
of ice rises there. Each pillar can take 15 damage
before being destroyed, and has a flat 10 defense.
Creatures of your choice within 5 feet of a pillar take
one level of slowed when they enter the spell’s area
for the first time on a turn or start the round there.
The icicles melt when the spell ends.

Pummeling Shadows

_Force and Dark. Ongoing._
You raise your clenching fist up, binding the
shadows to fists of force. Whenever a creature within
10 feet enters or begins the round in dim light or
darkness, you may choose for it to take 1d8 damage,
no more than once per round.

```
Punishing Glare
Force and Light. Ongoing.
You bring your clenching fist down, binding the
light into fists of force. Whenever a creature within
10 feet enters or begins the round in bright light, you
may choose for it to take 1d8 damage, no more than
once per round.
```

```
Pyromania
Fire. Ongoing.
You raise your open hands into the air, flickering
your fingers, causing flames to erupt around you.
Choose an adjacent space that contains flammable
materials. It bursts into flame. At the end of each
round, it spreads to all adjacent spaces with
flammable materials. Anyone who enters or ends the
round in the fire takes two levels of burning. You
may spend your action to stop the unnaturally fast
spread of the fire, but the fire does not cease to exist.
The fire can be put out by normal means.
```

```
Ravine
Earth. Ongoing.
You bring your hand in a chopping motion
towards the ground, causing it to split open in a deep
ravine. Choose four connected, unoccupied spaces
on the ground within 45 feet. A 15-foot deep hole
opens in those spaces.
```

```
Refraction
Light. Ongoing.
You lace wisps of light over you or an adjacent
creature, veiling them in a shimmering glow. The
creature counts as obscured against ranged attacks.
```

```
Rewind
Time.
Choose any number of creatures within 45 feet.
For each leveled condition affecting each of those
```

creatures, double the number of levels of that
condition affecting that creature.

Sandstorm
_Earth and Air. Ongoing._
You twist your hand into a fist, causing a brutal
sandstorm to whirl around you. Creatures of your
choice within 10 feet of you take 1d6 damage
whenever they enter or start the round in that space,
no more than once per round. Additionally, the storm
provides one level of cover from ranged attacks.

Searing Shadows

_Fire and Dark. Ongoing._
You rub your fingers together, heating nearby
areas of darkness. All spaces within 45 feet in dim
light or darkness ignite into pulsing, dark flames. So
long as those spaces remain in dim light or in
darkness, the flame remains. Whenever a creature
enters or begins the round in one of these spaces, it
takes one level of burning, and then one additional
level of burning if the space was in darkness, no
more than once per round.

Scat t e r
_Void._

You temporarily overlay the void over reality, if
only briefly. Choose any number of creatures within
45 feet of you. You may teleport each creature 10
feet in a direction of your choice to another
unoccupied space.

Shadowy Double

_Dark. Ongoing._
You drag darkness from around you to your
form. If you are in dim light, you may create
shadowy duplicates of yourself. The next two times
you are attacked, you instead take no damage, as
they attack a shadowy double.

```
Shield of Air
Force and Air. Instant.
You raise your hand in the air, causing the air to
harden, right before a weapon lands. Before attack
and defense rolls are made in an engagement, you
may roll your heart die and double it, adding it to a
creature’s defense roll from one attack during this
engagement.
```

```
Stasis Sphere
Void. Ongoing.
You pull in the void, cocooning the space around
you. All incoming and outgoing sources of damage
have their initial damage reduced by half. Round up
the remaining damage.
```

```
Static Cloud
Air. Ongoing.
You snap your fingers, charging the air around
you, creating a cloud of highly static energy
suspended in the air. Whenever a creature within 10
feet of you takes damage, you may have that creature
take three levels of dazed.
```

```
Steam Fissure
Fire and Water. Ongoing.
You open your hand towards the sky, forcing
fissures open in the ground around you, producing
geysers of scalding steam from the depths beneath
you. Choose four unoccupied spaces within 45 feet.
Creature’s take 1d10 damage whenever they enter or
start the round in that space, no more than once per
round.
```

```
Stone Skinned
Earth. Ongoing.
Whether literally or figuratively, you can make
your skin turn as tough as stone. You have +6 on
slashing and piercing defense rolls, and your move
speed decreases by 10 feet.
```
