10 feet takes damage, you may have them take a
level of burning if they don’t already have any levels
of burning.

Billowing Smoke

_Fire. Ongoing._
You cause thick, billowing smoke to erupt from a
nearby space. Choose a point within 45 feet. All
space within 5 feet of that point is obscured.
Additionally, creatures of your choice within the
smoke gain the suffocating condition.

Blast of Fire

_Fire and Force._
You point your finger, sending forth a bolt of
force and flame and blasting someone back. Choose
a creature within 45 feet. That creature is knocked
back 10 feet and then falls prone, taking two levels
of burning. On a success, they are not knocked
prone, and take only one level of burning.

Burning Brilliance
_Fire and Light. Ongoing._
You rub your fingers together, heating nearby
areas of light. All spaces within 45 feet in bright light
ignite into white, brilliant flames. So long as those
spaces remain in bright light, the flame remains. The
flames emit no light. Whenever a creature enters or
begins the round in one of these spaces, it takes one
level of burning.

Blinding Sun

_Light. Ongoing._
You rub a sphere of pure, brilliant light into your
fingers before casting it into the air. Choose a point
within 45 feet. Creatures of your choice within a 5-
foot radius of that point take three levels of blindness
whenever they enter or start the round in that space,
no more than once per round. For every 5 feet further

```
you are from the point creatures gain one level fewer
of blindness.
```

```
Cardinal Direction
Void and Force. Ongoing.
You align your fingers with the complex grid of
the void, applying its strict physical laws to the
world around you. Creatures of your choice within
45 feet of you can only move back and forth in one
direction each round (no diagonals).
```

```
Chilling Wind
Air.
You you beckon with your fingers, calling forth
the north wind, sending a bone chilling breeze
passing by. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet
of you immediately take four levels of slowed. If the
temperature is already below freezing, those
creatures also take one level of restrained.
```

```
Cloak of Shadows
Dark.
You drag wisps of shadows over your form,
obscuring yourself and actions. You count as
obscured until the end of your next engagement or
the end of the round, whichever comes first.
```

```
Cloud of Poison
Water. Ongoing.
You raise your finger to the air, spewing forth
billowing dark clouds of poison. All spaces within 10
feet of you are layered in a heavy cloud of poison.
Creatures count as obscured and take a level of
poisoned whenever they enter or start the round in
those spaces, no more than once per round. You are
immune to the poison effect for the duration of this
spell. Creatures cannot take more than one level of
poisoned with this effect. The cloud does not move
with you.
```

Cold Snap
_Water._
Snapping the fingers of your hand makes a loud
crack that causes all non-magical liquid within 45
feet to freeze solid. Creatures of your choice within
45 feet gain one level of restrained until the end of
the round. If they are wet or standing in water, they
instead gain 2 levels of restrained.

Collapse in Shadows
_Dark and Force._
You clap your fingers to your palm, dragging
everyone’s bodies to their shadows. Creatures of
your choice within 10 feet fall prone. If they are in
bright light, they gain two levels of restrained. If
they are in dim light, they gain one level of
restrained instead.

Crippling Aura

_Force. Ongoing._
You emit an aura that saps those around you of
their strength, greatly weakening them. Creatures of
your choice within 10 feet of you take three levels of
weakened whenever they enter or start the round in
that space, no more than once per round.

Deluge

_Water and Force._
You wave your hand in a curling motion, sending
a river of water rushing by, sweeping people away.
Choose a 10-foot by 20-foot section of the map.
Everyone in that area is swept to one of the 10-foot
sides of the rectangle, and lands prone. The water
puts out any fire in that area.

Earthen Shackles
_Earth and Force. Ongoing._
You grasp your hand into an upturned fist,
causing the ground to reach up and anchor those
above it. Creatures of your choice within 10 feet of

```
you take two levels of slowed whenever they enter or
start the round in that space, no more than once per
round.
```

```
Earthen Umbra
Earth and Dark. Ongoing.
You splay your fingers and raise your hand,
pulling shadows from the ground beneath you. Two
feet of pure shadow rise up from the ground and
away from all walls in a 45 foot radius. While prone
or adjacent to a wall affected by this spell, creatures
are obscured.
```

```
Eclipse
Dark.
You turn your cupped hand in the air, briefly
causing a shadow to pass before the sun. The sun
provides no light to any space in a 90 foot radius
until the end of the next round. This has no effect on
other sources of light.
```

```
Erosion
Force and Time.
You rub your fingers together, grinding time
against force, accelerating the natural desiccation
and erosion of a nearby object. Choose an inanimate
object no greater than a 10-foot cube. If it is softer
than wood, it erodes a way immediately. If it is softer
than stone, it erodes away in the next minute. If it is
as hard as stone, or harder, it crumbles over the
course of the next hour.
```

```
Ether Chains
Force. Ongoing.
You link you thumb and forefinger, causing
visible, ethereal chains to form between two
creatures’s souls, linking them together. Choose two
creatures within 45 feet of you and within 10 feet of

creatures are not within 10 feet of each other, they
