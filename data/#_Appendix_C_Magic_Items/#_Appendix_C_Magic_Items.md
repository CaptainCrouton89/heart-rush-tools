A collection of examples of various magical
items.

Wan d of F i r e b al l s
_Level 5. Fiery._
A great ball of fire erupts from the wand. Choose
a point within 90 feet. Every creature within 15 feet
of that point must make an agility saving throw. On
failure, a creature takes 5 levels of burning. On
success, the creature only takes three levels instead.

Sandals of Levitation
_Level 3. Aerial._

These shoes allow the wearer to levitate for brief
periods of time. As an action, you may choose to
activate them. For the next minute, you levitate one
foot of the ground. You gain a fly speed of 15 feet.
