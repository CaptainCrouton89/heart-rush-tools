# # Introduction

Heart Rush is a crunchy, fantasy TTRPG ruleset.
And it does combat really well.
Here’s how Heart Rush compares to the average
fantasy TTRPG:

* *- Crunchy **. There aren’t tons of tables, and the
math isn’t too bad, but this is far from “rules-lite”.

- ** It’s grittier and more simulationist **. Healing
  is slow, and fighting is dangerous. You probably
  won't die, but it’ll feel like you’re going to.
- ** Each round of combat is unique**. The core
  mechanics of combat discourage being predictable.
  This is a cornerstone of the Heart Rush rules.
  **- Fast, tactical combat. Seriously**. You’ve got
  lots of important decisions to make each round,
  and it doesn’t slow down the game since
  everyone’s making decisions in parallel.
  **- Highly cooperative **. Each class is designed to
  be played with the other classes, and will be best at
  allowing the other classes to shine. Everyone feels
  special.
- ** You’ll feel heroic eventually, but not for a
  while**. And when you do, it’s mainly because
  you’ve done really difficult things, not because
  you have heroic abilities.
  **- Constant leveling**. You don't have to wait for
  the level up—spend XP on a variety of stuff at
  different costs to improve your character.
  **- Wild character design.** A barbarian wizard,
  ninja detective, or fire-bender assassin are all
  totally viable builds.
  **- Extremely flexible trait system**. Plain English
  descriptions of your character result in mechanical
  bonuses and concrete hooks that drive the story
  forward.
  **- Hyper-flexible elemental magic**. For example,
  you can be an air-bender and do all the things you
  should be able to do as an air-bender. And it's not
  tied to any class, so you can tack that onto
  whatever type of build you want.
  **- Fail-forward mechanics**. The story won’t
  always grind to a halt on failures.

Origin of the Name
When initial rounds of feedback on the
rules came in, people derided the game as a
“heartbreaker”—a term in the TTRPG design
community given to games into which their
authors pour their hearts, only to have fail since
the games don’t differentiate themselves
enough from D&D. And it was fair—these
rules originally stemmed from my frustrations
with D&D; I had wanted to make a game that
was essentially D&D, but just better at doing it
than D&D itself. Of course, that’s not possible,
and I was rightly made fun of.
However, Heart Rush has come a long way
since then. It still has some overlapping design
goals, but there are major differences. It relies
more on skillful GMs. It’s much grittier. And
it’s got more tactical combat that is frequently
extremely tense, and can feel very terrifying.
It’s a rush.
And thus, the name was born. Yes, this
game was, and to some degree always will be,
a little bit of a heartbreaker. But also, no game
gets my heart pumping in the same way. And
thus: Heart Rush.

Why Should I Run This?

Heart Rush is probably not going to feel that
different to run compared to most crunchy fantasy
TTRPGs. However, it does try to balance the crunch
with more narrative-forward elements. The two I
want to highlight are the aspect system, and the skill
check complications.
With aspects, players will describe their character
in plain English. The mechanics will incentivize
them to have both positive and negative descriptions,
and then to actually RP them out in play. As the GM,
you don’t have to keep track of your players and
their flaws and reward them when they’re good;
they’ll let you know exactly when, and they will go
out of their way to complicate the story in a way

```
appropriate to their character, because doing so is the
only way they can use the positive sides of their
aspects. The system is self balancing, and places the
vast majority of the work on the players themselves.
The end result is players helping you tell a more
interesting story.
Complications are a mechanic that come in to
play when players are making skill checks. When
they roll, they sometimes have the chance to replace
a bad roll with a better roll that has negative,
unrelated side effects. Those negative, unrelated side
effects are up to you to decide, but in my experience
they’re quite easy to come up with. When the players
have voluntarily chosen to take a complication, it’s a
golden ticket for you to make the situation worse in
the most narratively satisfying way, without players
feeling like it’s unfair.

Heart Rush Combat
Heart Rush is a highly specialized combat machine. Sure, it’s got enough framework to handle all of
the noncombatant stuff, but when combat begins is when its engine purrs to life and you see Heart Rush
take off.
This was intentional—both the specialization, and lack of great depth out of combat. From my
experience, most fun that happens outside of combat isn’t due to great mechanics, but due to how the
story unfolds, and the interactions with NPCs. These things are very dependent on who the GM is and
how they want to run it, and I didn’t want to get in the way of that. Talk more, roll less is a motto I stand
behind. However, when it comes to combat, having that framework matters. Combat has high stakes,
every maneuver makes a difference, and everyone has different but potentially equally high impact on it,
second by second. I don’t think that argument can be made for the other pillars of a fantasy adventure. For
this reason, combat rules got special privileges. I didn’t want them to merely facilitate the fiction—I
wanted them to be thrilling, cooperative, and exciting. So that’s what I did.
While designing the rules, I had to make sure they passed the blank-room combat test. This is a test
where you run combat in which none of the combatants have abilities, and there’s no terrain. In many
games, this can be a disaster—those are core features. However, I believe they’re both crutches. First,
relying on fun abilities scratches only one kind of itch, and it’s something that any game can employ.
Second, using terrain places the onus on the GM to make the combat fun, rather than the rules themselves.
If the combat is still fun without either of those things, it means that those rules are solid. That’s what
makes Heart Rush special.

Why Should I Play?

This game is for people who like combat and
mechanics and getting into the weeds of character
design and optimization. Heart Rush has other stuff
going on too, but if you actively _don’t_ like those
things, you’ll be missing out on a lot of what Heart
Rush has to offer. As a quick list, you will like Heart
Rush if...

- You like making a smart tactical play, but hate
  having to wait five minutes every round to do so.
- You like spending hours theory crafting strange
  character concepts that actually work.
- You like coordinating with your allies and
  dunking on enemies through the power of synergy.
- You like roleplaying flaws in your character,
  but want to get mechanically rewarded for it in
  gameplay.
- You want to mix and match fantasy character
  tropes to make your own, creative archetypes.
- You like grittier settings with crunch.
  Heart Rush isn’t the perfect solution for every
  desire in a TTRPG. But it’s a damn good one for
  some of them.

Te a m F ig h t He ro G a me s
A core inspiration for Heart Rush came
from team fighting video games. In these
games, each team has a squad of players with
their own specializations, and then the teams
would duke it out and eventually one prevails.
One of things that stood out to me about
these games was how important it was for a
solid team composition. If the team was
missing someone of a certain role, the entire
team fell apart. Players weren’t prioritizing
maximizing their damage, they were
prioritizing their ability to perform their
specific role. That was very appealing to me—
people like feeling like they’re the best, and
everyone can be the best when they’re all
trying to be the best at something different.
Although many tactical TTRPGs have
some concept of different roles and combat
specialization, I’ve felt they were somewhat
weak, and more thematic than functional. I
wanted to change that. In Heart Rush, there are
only three core classes—tanks, damage, and
support. You can layer a bunch of flavor and
additional mechanics on top of them, but those
classes form a foundation for your character.
This framework let me build a system where
each class is vastly benefited by having the
other classes present, and will vastly benefit
them in turn. Everyone feels extremely
valuable, even if they haven’t min-maxed to the
same degree as another player.
