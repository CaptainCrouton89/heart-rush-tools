# # Creating a Monster

RPGs are great when played by the seat of your
pants. Unfortunately, Heart Rush is a fairly tactical
game that requires some degree of preparation for
combat. On the bright side, even a boring monster
can be exciting to fight in Heart Rush, and if you
want to make the monster more interesting it is not
difficult.

Base Stats

If you are creating a monster, you will absolutely
need to know each of the following stats:

- HP
- Heart die
- Might, agility, and cunning dice
- Weapon die
- Armor
  It doesn't really matter what you assign to these
  values—you just want them to be “realistic-ish”.
  Bear in mind that a player starts with 40 HP, a d8
  heart die, d6-ish ability dice, and a d10-ish weapon,
  and maybe 2-6 armor. Use that as a metric to build
  your monster, and scale the values up or down.

Bells and Whistles

If you have all of the above, you’ve got a
standard monster, and it's good enough to use in a
fight. If you want the monster to have more flavor,
it’s a good idea to add abilities. Monsters don’t need
to have lots of abilities, they just need ones that ooze
with the flavor of that monster. A basilisk needs an
ability that paralyzes people. A cobra needs to be
able to poison people. A fire dragon needs to be able
to breathe fire on people.

Ability Templates
If you don't want to come up with your own
ability from scratch, use an ability template from the
list below.
```

- ** Aura ** : At the beginning of each creature’s turn
  within X feet...
- ** Attack Side Effect ** : When this creature
  directly beats a stance...
- ** AoE ** : As priority ability, everyone within
  [area]...
- ** Damage Side Effect ** : When this creature deals
  damage...
- ** Non-Weapon Attack** : Target creature/s make a
  [ability] saving throw. On a failure, those
  creatures... On a success...
