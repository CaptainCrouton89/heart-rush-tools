# # Rests & Healing

There are a few ways to regain hit points. The
primary method is by taking rests, but magic, racial
abilities, potions, and more can all cause healing in
other ways.

Rests

You can heal hit points, refresh heart dice, and
reduce wounds all with rests. There are two types of
rests: short rests and long rests.

Short Rest

A short rest is nothing more than 10 minutes of
stationary relaxation. When you take a short rest,
your heart die returns to its maximum. You can take
any number of short rests per day.

Lo n g R e s t

When you go to sleep for the night, that is a long
rest. Long rests must be at least 7 hours, and you can
only take one each day. When taking a long rest
away from shelter, bed, and warmth, you must also
make a sleeping check. Succeeding at a sleeping
check results in a “successful” long rest. On failing
the check, you have an unsuccessful long rest.
To make the sleeping check, roll 1d100 and add
all the relevant modifiers from the Sleeping
Conditions table below. On a 100 or higher, you
succeed.
While you do have warmth, a bed, and full
shelter, you do not need to make this check and are
assumed to succeed. If you do not rest for the night,

```
take the penalties associated with failing a sleeping
check.
```

```
Successful Sleeping Check
On a success, reduce the ranks of each of your
wounds by one, and heal hit points up to your current
maximum (it will be reduced if you have wounds).
```
