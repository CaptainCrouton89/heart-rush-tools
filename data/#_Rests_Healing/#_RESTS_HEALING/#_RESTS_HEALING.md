## # RESTS & HEALING

```
Example
You just survived a nasty fight. You have 14
hit points, a d4 heart die, and a rank 12 wound.
At first, you take a short rest—you have more
distance to cover before the day is done. Your
heart die becomes a d8 once more. Then, night
comes, and you take a long rest. It’s warm, but
you have no shelter. You fail your sleeping check.
Since your maximum hit points was 28 (40 - 12),
and you are currently at 14, you regain 7 hit
points, going up to 21. Additionally, you start the
next day with a level of dazed.
The next day you reach your destination,
getting a bed, warmth, and shelter, thereby
automatically succeeding your sleeping check.
Your wound decreases to rank 11, you heal to 29
hp (40 - 11), and you remove your level of dazed.
You realize you can spend some time in the
town without feeling pressured to leave, so you
stay safe and don’t leave, reducing your wound
by one each night till fully healed after 11 more
days.
```

Failed Sleeping Check

On a failure, do not reduce the ranks of your
wounds, and regain half of your missing hit points,
rounded down. Additionally, take a level of
weakened, off-balanced, or dazed, chosen at random.
A second night of failed sleep inflicts two conditions
at random, and a third night, along with every night
thereafter, inflicts one level of each condition. A
successful long rest removes all conditions gained
this way.

Healing

Besides rests, other effects and abilities may
cause you to heal hit points. When you heal hit

points, you cannot increase your hit points greater
than any restricted maximum due to wounds you
might have.

Healing Potions
Not every world setting will play with
healing potions, but if your game does, these
rules work well. One hour after drinking a
healing potion, reduce the rank of each of your
wounds by one and regain 20 hit points.

GM Note
The pacing of Heart Rush tends to be a bit
slower than other games; letting players take long
rests does not let them heal all that much, so
don’t feel pressured to pack multiple combats
into only a single day. A long trip through the
wilderness where good rest is uncertain and
combat is intermittent is plenty grueling for most
parties.
