# # Par ag on A b i l i t i e s

After reaching combat rank 4, further ranks come
in the form of paragon levels. Paragon levels are
awarded to the group at the GM’s discretion, usually
as a reward for a feat of incredible triumph. When
you gain a paragon level, you may gain an ability
from this list.
Paragon levels have tags on them indicating if
there are any limitations on which classes can take
the paragon level. If your class isn’t listed, you can’t
take the paragon level. Additionally, some paragon
levels also have a tag indicating a minimum paragon
level you must be at in order to gain the ability. This
will take the form “PL: X,” where X is the paragon
level you must be at or above.
