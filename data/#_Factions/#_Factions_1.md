# # Factions

Followers are those who ascribe to your
ideology. One in every hundred followers will
actively convert other followers, which roughly
counteracts the passive loss of followers as people
are attracted to other ideologies. For this reason, the
number of followers you have remains neutral.
Devotees are passionate ideologues who share
your desire for a different world. They will be named
NPCs, have skills, personalities, goals, and desires of
their own. You may give them orders, and they will
follow them to the best of their ability. If the GM
deems the order to be too risky to the devotees life or
wellbeing, you may have to pass one or more
persuasion checks to convince them to perform the
task.

Sacred Vow

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
Make your sacred vow by creating a new aspect
at rank one. You cannot gain DP for fulfilling this
aspect. Whenever you gain a bonus to a roll from
this aspect, double the bonus. Unlike other aspects,

```
you may apply DP towards this aspect on A/D rolls
and saving throws if they are applicable.
If you ever fail to fulfill any obligation this
aspect implies (as determined by the GM), you lose
this talent. You do not regain any XP.
Destiny Level
You may triple the bonus instead. Should you
break your vow, you take a level of mental
vulnerability for a number of months equal to the
square of the rank of the aspect.
