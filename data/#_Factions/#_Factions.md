My gang vs your nation:
```

- We can both effectively spy on each other
- Nation crushes me in battle
- Individual acts I do can affect nation’s army,
  but it would only matter if we were even
  remotely close
- Nation can buy way more than me
- Although I’m more cohesive, we both suffer
  similar internal struggles
- When it’s a small scale fight, I want to be
  able to participate in it (take over neighboring
  faction)
- On a large scale battle, I need to be able to
  participate in some battles but not all of them.
- I.e. some fights must be abstracted, others
  not. However, the ones that aren’t abstracted
  need to matter more.

```
Tasks PCs must be able to do:
```

- Defend their stronghold from invaders
- Lead faction/or country in revolution against
  country - Plant memory of gnomes entering
  city to shift blame onto them.

```
Need:
Battle rules (for playing out individual battles)
Resource conflict rules: I’m leveraging my
money and resources and intel to undermine another
power
```

- Should be able to force them to change
  policy

```
size * might die. Swingier at low levels,
terrifying.

Size affects wealth. Wealth determines how
much might you have. Only relevant when you’re
using armies to fight. “army” requires 100 person
population.

Armies only matter when you have company
wealth. Company wealth is a score out of 10. Factor
of size. If it’s rich, it’s one greater than size. If it’s
poor country, it’s one less than size. If it’s absurdly
rich, 2 greater, or 2 less if absurdly poor.

Faction actions are organized into “fronts”. They
have a rank, determining how powerful that force for
change is. For example, Erasnus has a front of

```
“Remove myorna from the trade alliance.” Myorna
contains factions with conflicting fronts: “Remain in
the alliance” and “Remove ourselves from the
alliance and retreat underground”.
Without player interaction, the greater front wins
when appropriate.
Fronts don’t have to be explicitly carried out—
they just succeed. However, counter-actions carried
out by players remove points from front. Front ranks
don’t have to be calculated until the players interfere.
Then assign them.
```

```
Anything faction related is broken into long-term
goals. On successes, you build points towards
reaching goal. Your goal can be to do X, or it can be
to stop some other country from doing Y. Totally
player oriented—other factions just succeed at what
they want to do. When front is opposed, the front has
power equal to size of the faction. Must overcome
the front in order to stop it from happening.
```

```
Must be significantly higher than the neighboring
communities of same territory size (neighboring
settlements if settlement, neighboring countries if a
country). Use all countries/states that you border or
have a road going to. Add one surplus for each
neighboring territory you have more of it than.
Subtract for each neighboring territory you have less
of it than. It it’s equal, or too close to tell, there’s no
difference. Can’t have negative surplus, and can’t
gain more than 3 surplus from a single thing.
```

```
Surpluses:
```

- Farmland
- Mined resources
- Artisans and skilled laborers
- Scholarship
- Cheap labor
- Sky ports

```

- Sea ports
- Wood

You get a standing army of 1% of population for
a single surplus. You can increase it by .5% as many
times thereafter for another surplus each. Army only
exists after number of months equal to country size.
Can hired in a single month for double the surplus.

Internal Projects

When you wish to improve your faction
internally, unopposed, it costs a single surplus to
begin work on a single project. Projects take a
minimum number of months equal to the size of
faction. Projects are any big task that wouldn’t
happen automatically for any faction of your size. It
can be difficult to judge what counts as a faction
project, but as a rough guideline, it should be at least
as rare as something that only some factions of
equivalent caliber have. For example, a harbor would
count as a project for a city state, since many city
states don’t have harbors. However, you don’t have
to spend surplus on a harbor if your faction
represents an entire country, since many countries
have many harbors.

If you want to deal with a front without having to
interact with it, GM may allow you to fight it by
making your own, counter-front. Requires surplus
equal to front value, plus your size rank. Counts as a
project, therefore costs an extra surplus. For
example, if they are pressuring your country to
collapse in revolution, with force 11 (their country’s
rank), if you are rank 9, you’d have to spend 3
surplus fending that off. Even if you are higher rank
than them, still requires one surplus to apply your
rank as a counter-front.
If you want to destroy a kingdom from internal
rebellion, or some other way act directly hostile to
another country, you can’t apply rank. That is a new

```
front from your kingdom. Requires 1 surplus—new
front. Expected to treat it like normal front that has
to be chipped away at with player action.
```

```
Persuade neighbors to allow passage of your
ships through their channel. They are 2 bigger, so
rank 2 challenge. 1 surplus because it is a new
project from country. It’s contested, so can’t apply.
Normal front (can’t apply surplus to it), going to
require 5 to overcome. Reward: not having bad shit
happen.
```

```
Reward for doing things that don't directly
impact surpluses? Why enter trade alliance? Why
build great temple? Why build another village.
```

- Pop growth
- Remove threat of bad thing

```
If you also wanted to be working on building
another sea-port, that’s another surplus, will take 3
years. used up all your surplus now, maybe.
```

```
Player controlled fronts: How?
```

```
Likewise, can calculate “security” score by
looking at different categories. This can be negative?

More faction ideas
```

Every asset has a power, between 1 and 10, a
type (force, wealth, intelligence).
When might v might, use % dice (m1 / (m1 +
m2)).
When might vs wealth, wealth can’t defend, auto
win for might.
When asset is damaged, rank decreases by 1.

```
Come up with rank out of 10 for any faction.
Might, wealth, cunning.
10: mighty kingdom
8: typical kingdom
6: Powerful city state, very weak kingdom
4: Powerful guild
3: typical guild
2: small club
1: you and your friends
```

When assets attack, they use their attack tag vs
defense tag. Usually same. Add your faction rank to
the roll. On success, attacking asset activates effect,
or may deal damage to defending asset. On failure,
defending unit deals damage (or defensive effect) to
attacking unit.
