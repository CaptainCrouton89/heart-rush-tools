Sutin 2, Kun 1, Phreo 1, Tuul 1, Mim 1, Xin 1.
Make a small nearby tornado and control it for a
minute: Su 3, Ostum 3, Tuul 3, Mim 2, Xin 2.
Destroy only the poison in a goblet of poisoned
water: Pel 1, Taziin 1, Tuul 1, Mim 1, Xin 3.

Determining Spell Cost

A spell’s cost can be calculated by multiplying
the technique and modifiers together (note: not the
domain rank). Keep note of this number and save it
for later.
For example, making the wooden chair glow
would be level 1 (1 x 1 x 1 x 1) , while making a
small tornado would be level 36 (3 x 2 x 3 x 2), and
destroying the poison would be 3 (3 x 1 x 1).
When determining spell cost, the GM is at full
liberty to increase or decrease ranks of individual
components of a spell at their discretion. These
variations can be explained by the finicky nature of
Deoric spell casting.

Ta r g e t i n g a S u b j e c t

If you wish to target a living creature with your
spell, you must first determine your intent. There are
two levels of intent one can have: neutral or positive
intent, and negative intent.

you must also take into account the subject cost
of your target. Living things are extremely complex,
and without knowing a creature’s true name, you
have to describe the creature in all of its complexity
rather than use a single word to identify it. This
makes casting spells targeting living things much
more difficult. If you do cast a spell targeting a
creature, first determine the subject cost, using the
following table.

```
After determining the subject cost of your spell,
multiply the spell cost by the square of the subject
cost. For example, let’s say the spell to remove
poison from a dead human body costs 5 energy. If
that body is alive, that same spell now costs 45 (5 x
32 ). If you know the true name of the subject, the
subject cost becomes one.
```

```
Deoric Knowledge
In order to actually cast a spell, you must meet
two requirements: energy, and knowledge. We have
already covered calculating the spell cost, so we will
now cover how knowledge of domains and
techniques affects the casting.
For each domain and technique of Deoric, you
will have an associated rank of knowledge. By
default, a new character starts with zero ranks of
knowledge in each domain and technique. As you
increase your ranks of knowledge, it will allow you
to invent new Deoric spells, as well as have higher
odds of success at casting Deoric spells.
```

```
Casting the Spell
When casting a spell, there are two things to
determine. The first is if you are reading the spell, or
reciting it from memory. Reading it is more likely to
result in a successful casting, but is often less
convenient.
