Enchantments &

Artifacts

While the energy used to cast a Deoric spell is
usually used up in the casting, some materials bear
naturally energy producing or storing properties, and
can be enchanted with Deoric magic to become
magical artifacts. Since the materials of the artifact
provide some of the energy for the magic, artifacts
can have magical properties that remain potent
indefinitely. For example, a sword that can be always
activated to erupt in flames, or a magnifying glass
that reveals an examined object’s history when used.
Different materials have different magical properties,
which can make them more or less suited for
different enchantments.
In order to create an artifact, you must have the
crafting skill to create the item if it doesn’t exist
already, the runescribing skills to engrave the artifact
in Deoric runes, and the Deoric knowledge of the
spell in order to know what to write. In addition, the
object you are enchanting must have the magical
capacity for the spell you wish to enchant it with.
Larger objects have more magical capacity, and more
magical (and typically therefore more expensive)
materials have more magical capacity.

Magical Capacity

Every artifact has some magical capacity which
defines how powerful the spells contained can be.
Larger artifacts, made of more magically potent
materials, can store more powerful spells, while
smaller artifacts with less valuable materials can
hold only weaker spells. To determine the capacity
of an item, sum the value of the all of the magical

```
materials used in the item. You can see the values of
each material in the chart below.
When you enchant an item, the item must have
magical capacity greater than or equal to the spell
cost of the spell you wish to enchant the item with.
Upon enchanting the item, subtract the spell’s spell
cost from the capacity of the item to get the new,
remaining capacity of the item. A single item can
have multiple enchantments on it, so long as it has
the capacity for all of them.
```

```
Enchanting the Artifact
To enchant an artifact with a Deoric spell, you
must meet all of the knowledge requirements for the
domain and technique of the spell, as well as the
additional energy costs.
Although the materials of the artifact provide
some of the energy, sacrifice is still required to
enchant an item. With higher sacrifice, the item can
be used more frequently, while with less sacrifice, it
```

```

can only be used rarely. To determine how much
additional soul energy is required for a specific
frequency of casting, refer to the table below, and
multiply the energy cost of the spell by the energy
multiplier from that row.
While enchanting an artifact, the required soul
energy is used up and channeled into the artifact
throughout the process. Each day, you must spend 8
hours in a workshop with access to engraving tools,
and must contribute an amount of spirit energy no
less than the energy required for a full casting of that
spell. Once you have contributed an amount of spirit
energy equal to or greater than the total soul energy
required for the enchantment, you are finished
enchanting the item. This takes a minimum of one
day.

Setting the Activation

The last step in the enchantment process is
determining the activation trigger for the spell stored
within your artifact. There are several types of
triggers you can create, determined by your skill as a
runescribe and enchanter. Unless otherwise stated,
you can only craft items that can be activated at
extremely slow speed.

```
Extremely Slow
The spell is activated after one hour of use.
```

```
Very Slow
The spell is activated after one minute of use.
```

```
Slow
The spell can be activated as an action.
```

```
Quick
The spell can be activated without an action.
```

```
Immediate
The spell can be activated without an action at
instant speed.
```

```
Pas s i v e
The spell is always active.
