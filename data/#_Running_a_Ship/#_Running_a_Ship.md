# # Running a Ship

Ship Health

Every ship has at least three components: Hull,
Sails, and Steering. They are the three most critical
components to any ship, and their state of repair
should be tracked when players own their own ship
and its management is central to the game. Sky ships
and ice breakers will have a fourth component—the
engine—with rules listed here as well.
Each component on a ship can be in four states
of repair: new, weathered, broken, and irreparable.
When bad stuff happens to a ship, it can cause the
state of one or more of its components to fall. A new
ship will start with all of its components in the
“new” state. If the ship is used but nothing is broken,
the ship’s components will all be either “new” or
“weathered”. Components in the “weathered” state
have no penalties, but are closer to breaking. When a
component becomes broken or irreparable, it comes
with special consequences to the ship and crew,
listed in the next sections.

Sails

Sails include all their related equipment, such as
masts, sails, and lines. When sails become broken,
the ship moves at half speed. Broken sails represent
shredded sails, a crack forming in the mast, or
destroyed or missing lines. If the sails become
irreparably broken, the ship cannot move. If your
mast breaks or your sails are destroyed, then the sails
are irreparable.

Hull
The hull is critical to the structural integrity of
the ship, making up the entire outer shell of the boat
making contact with the water. When the hull is
broken, the ship has sprung one or more minor leaks.
If the leak/s are not addressed soon, the ship will
eventually sink. A ship with a broken hull will
automatically enter the irreparable state after 24
hours if the hull is not repaired. An irreparable hull is
one that has one or more massive leaks, and is no
longer capable of staying afloat. The ship cannot be
repaired, and will sink in the next hour.
```

```
Steering
The steering includes all parts of the ship critical
to maneuvering the ship, such as the rudder, keel,
helm, and gears and shafts connecting the helm to
the rudder. These parts of the ship are generally more
fragile and will break easily if exposed to
unexpected forces. When the steering is broken, you
cannot change course or make course corrections.
You move in the direction of the wind (chosen at
random by the GM). You may choose to move at full
speed in that direction if your sails are unfurled.
When the steering is broken,

Engine
Icebreakers and airships have aether engines,
critical to their locomotion. Aether engines require
massive fuel tanks of aether and some complex
machinery for turning that aether into physical
rotation used to turn massive propellers. When the
engine is broken, it will not run. Any benefits
conferred by your ships engine are lost. In an airship,
```

this means you cannot change altitude or exit an
astral current. In an icebreaker, this means you
cannot break ice.

Ship Repair

When a component of your ship is weathered or
broken, it can be repaired. Repairing your ship is a
camp action. It takes four camp actions to return a
component from broken to weathered. To return a
component to the new state, a brand new component
must be installed. The cost and work required for this
is up to the GM.
