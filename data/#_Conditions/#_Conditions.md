# # Conditions

A variety of conditions can affect players and
enemies alike. They generally give advantage or
disadvantage to different sorts of rolls.

Tag s

There are three different types of tags each
condition can have: _leveled_ , _fading_ , and _ongoing_.

Le v e l e d

Some of the conditions are _leveled_ , meaning that
multiple instances of that condition can be applied.
These levels also stack, so if the same condition is
applied, both levels are added together. For example,
if a moon-viper bites you, it could apply two levels
of poison, giving you D2 to all rolls. If it then bit you
again, you would then increase the number of levels
of poisoned affecting you to four.
Conditions cannot be stacked greater than five
times. Once a creature has gained five levels of a
condition, further levels of that condition are
ignored.

Fading

Some conditions have _fading_ , which means that
the condition will quickly alleviate. When you take
levels of a condition that has fading, remove one
level of that condition at the start of each round.

Ongoing

An ongoing condition continues until otherwise
noted. It may be moments, it may be hours, it may be
days, and it might even be forever.
