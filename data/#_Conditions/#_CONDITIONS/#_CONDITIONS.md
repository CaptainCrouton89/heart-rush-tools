complications or failures on 3s as well, and another

Mental Conditions
These condition are likely to arise from magical
effects.
```

```

help action to help you calm and align your thoughts.
```

```

You are terrified of something. You have
disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls so long as you

you cannot willingly approach the source of your
fear. As an action, you may make a cunning saving
throw contested by the source’s presence challenge
number to immediately remove all levels of
frightened.
```

```
GM Note
These mental conditions are pretty powerful,
and generally shouldn’t be thrown around unless
it’s supposed to be a very powerful effect, or if
the effect is from a magical source.
```

_Leveled. Ongoing._
You are overcome with rage at another creature.
You have disadvantage on A/D and ability rolls
against any other creature besides the source of your

remove all levels of enraged.

you are friendly, you become allied.
The source of the charm has advantage on all
presence checks made against you. If the charmer
takes any hostile action against you, the charm effect
ends immediately.

Status Conditions

While many of these conditions can be caused by
combat, some of them have more to do with your
environment than any interaction with others.

stated differently). You have advantage on defense
rolls against ranged attacks, and have disadvantage
