## # CONDITIONS

Creature Climber
_Ongoing._
You have A3 on attack rolls against the creature
you are climbing on.
You may move on the creature using your climb
speed. The creature counts as difficult terrain.
If you would push the creature you are climbing
on any distance, instead inflict 1d6 damage.
If you take damage or are forced to move, you
must roll a might or agility saving throw against the
damage taken or distance pushed, whichever is
greater, falling off of the creature on a failure.
You may use 5 feet of movement to hop off the
creature when you can move.
Whenever the creature being climbed on moves,
you move with it.

Climbed-on

_Ongoing._
You have D3 on attacks against creatures
climbing on you.
As an action, you may try to shake off the
creatures that are climbing on you. Make a might or
agility check contested by the might or agility check
of every creature climbing on you. On a success,
they are thrown off.

Grappling

_Ongoing._
Your move speed becomes zero and you cannot
take the dash action. You have disadvantage on all A/
D rolls and any ability checks requiring motion.
When you sidestep, the grappled creature moves to
the space you were in previously.
If you are prone, you cannot stand up while
grappling.
Whenever the creature you are grappling is
forced to move, you may choose to be forced to
move that distance with it or release the grapple,
ending the grappled condition for it.

```
If you are forced to move, the grappled creature
moves with you.
Any damage that you or the grappled creature
takes due to forced movement is also applied to the
other.
```

```
Grappled
Ongoing.
You have 1 level of restrained.
As an action, you may try to break free. Make a
might or agility check contested by the might or
agility check of the creature grappling you. If either
creature is larger, it gets a level of advantage on their
roll for each level of size difference. On a success,
you are no longer grappled.
Levels of restrained inflicted from being
grappled do not inflict disadvantage on this roll.
Any damage that you or a creature grappling you
takes due to forced movement is also applied to the
other.
