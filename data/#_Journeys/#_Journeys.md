# # Journeys

When the travel is safe and not a focus of
gameplay, such as on a well-traveled road between
nearby towns, you only need to know the basics of
travel speed so you can determine how long it takes
(described below). In these cases, you are assumed
to reach your destination in the appropriate amount
of time and the game can continue at the new
location.
However, in cases where travel is a major focal
point of gameplay, the rest of this section describes
the rules for travel.

Tr av e l B a s i cs

The first step in beginning a journey is figuring
out how long it will take. You can calculate this by
using your daily travel speed. The GM should then
segment the journey, and add events, which will be
explained later in this section.

Travel Speed

Your travel speed is calculated based off your
movement speed. The following sections describe
how far you can travel in different terrain. These
distances represent miles of progress towards your
destination, not absolute distance traveled.
When you begin, the GM should calculate how
long it will take reach your destination, assuming
everything goes well.

On Foot

If you are on a path on flat ground, you can cover
24 miles per day. In difficult terrain, such as swamps,

```
jungles, and mountains (as determined by the GM),
this distance is halved. If you are not on a path, this
movement speed is also halved.
```

```
On a Vehicle
If you are on horseback, in a carriage, or
traveling via some other land-vehicle, use the
vehicle’s daily travel speed rather than your own.
Horses and carriages have the same movement speed
as humans for the purposes of calculating daily
travel speeds, but they will have greater carrying
capacity and will not be penalized by your own
movement penalties, such as those from armor.
```

```
Segmenting the Journe y
On long trips through varied terrain, the GM
should segment the journey into different distinct
sections, broken at each major change in terrain. For
example, if the the trip is through the mountains and
into the forests beyond, there may be a segment of
mountain travel and a segment of forest travel. Most
trips do not need multiple segments.
When segmenting trips, the GM should calculate
how long each segment should take based off the
distance and travel speed in that segment of the
journey.
```

```
Events
Besides survival, these are what make a journey
into an adventure. Events can include things such as
falling avalanches, bandits attacking, tombs being
discovered, and just about anything else you can
imagine creating a situation where danger or further
investigation might be warranted.
```

The GM should add between one and five events
to most journeys, sticking with lower numbers on
shorter journeys or longer, safer ones, and higher
numbers for longer, more dangerous journeys. If
there are multiple segments in the trip, it’s usually a
good idea to add at least one event per segment.

Making the

Journey

When you actually leave for the journey, for each
segment, the GM should determine if any of the
following survival challenges are necessary to the
wellbeing of the players during the segment, and
couldn’t be reasonably prepared for or already
accounted for:

- Keep Watch
- Navigate - Collect Water - Gather Food - Find Shelter
  If you are bringing enough food and water for the
  duration of the segment, for example, the GM should
  not include _Gather Food_ or _Collect Water_. The tasks
  the GM deems as necessary will each require one or
  more successful skill checks in order to avoid
  turning into a bigger problem for you and your party.
  You or someone else from the party must make a
  skill check for each of these needs, using the
  challenge number from the table below. The same
  person can make multiple skill checks, but they get
  disadvantage on each skill checks they make for
  every additional skill check they have to make.
  Conversely, anyone not making a skill check can
  grant advantage to exactly one skill check being
  made by another player.
