## # JOURNEYS

```
GM Note
Some journeys don’t need any skill checks
for their travel phases. If the players are traveling
through farmland, just use the travel phase as a
brief montage opportunity before having an event
phase.
GM Note
Check out the Journey chapter in the GM
section of this book. There’s lots of advice on
how to come up with interesting events and
advice on when to use them.
```

To t a l S u c c e s s

On succeeding at every skill check, the journey
progresses to the event phase. No challenge phases
are triggered.

Skill Check Failure

If a skill check is failed, players can face
consequences. Each skill check has its own
consequences for failure. If multiple skill checks are
failed, the GM may choose to resolve them in
whichever order they wish.

Skill Check Consequences

Each travel phase skill check has it’s own
consequences for failure.

Keep Watch

Succeeding on this skill check represents keeping
a watchful eye on your surroundings throughout the
travel phase. When you successfully keep watch,
when an event occurs, you and the party see any
threats present before they see you.
On a failure, any people or creatures from an
event surprise you.

```
Navigate
Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently staying on track towards your
destination.
On a failure, the party fails to make progress
towards the destination and the party enters an event
phase. This event does not count towards the total
number of events for the journey.
```

```
Gather Food
Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently fishing, hunting, or foraging
successfully enough to keep everyone fed during the
travel phase.
On a failure to gather food, the travel phase ends
and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get food,
you cannot resume the travel phase. You may have to
eat pack animals, consume unidentified plants, hunt
more dangerous creatures, or simply go hungry until
food becomes available again.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that food is still an issue
for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll this skill
check for the travel phase.

Collect Water

Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently finding enough clean drinking water to
keep everyone hydrated during the travel phase.
On a failure to collect water, the travel phase
ends and a challenge phase begins. Until you can get
water, you cannot resume the travel phase. You may
have to drink unclean water, journey to more
dangerous water sources, or else simply go thirsty
and wait until water becomes available again.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that water is still an
issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll
this skill check for the travel phase.

Find Shelter

Succeeding on this skill check represents
consistently finding safe places to build shelter and
get good rest away from the elements. If you have a
tent, you get +4 to this roll. If you have a bedroll,
you get +3 to this roll. If you are not at a comfortable
temperature, as per the rules in the Temperature
section, you get -3 to this roll per temperature tier
you are off by.
On a failure to find shelter, the travel phase ends.
It is nightfall and you cannot find a safe place to set
up camp. You may have to sleep in a more dangerous
location, or skip sleep altogether.
When the challenge phase triggered by this
failure ends, if the GM rules that shelter is still an
issue for the remainder of the travel phase, re-roll
this skill check for the travel phase.

Other Interruptions

If you wish to stop the travel phase at any point,
you may do so. Regular game-time resumes until
you and your party agree to resume the journey. So
long as your general ability to travel survive and

```
travel safely has not changed, you should resume the
previous travel phase, keeping its rolls and results.

challenge phase, you

Challenge Phase

```
When a challenge phase begins, the montage of
travel is over. Challenge phases begin when you
have no food, no water, or no shelter. Gameplay
slows down to normal pace. You must now make
decisions as you would in a normal situation—the
GM describes the situation, and you have to figure
out what to do.
If you want to continue travel as you did before,
you must now make daily checks to keep watch,
gather food, collect water, navigate, and find shelter.
Everyone should make skill checks for these as they
would for the travel phase, unless they are doing
something uniquely different compared to what they
would have been doing during the travel phase. For
example, if you were riding a horse, ran out of food,
entered a challenge phase, and then butchered your
