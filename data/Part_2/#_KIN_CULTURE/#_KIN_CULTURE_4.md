## # KIN & CULTURE

Savant

Savants, for reasons unknown, are born with rare
differences in their physiology, sometimes
sacrificing the ability to move, sense, or
communicate effectively in exchange for excelling
greatly in other ways. They can be born into nearly
any race, from anyone. In some communities,
savants are worshipped as supernatural beings, while
in others they are shunned and treated as outcasts.

Aspects

Choose one aspect from the following list, and
one from the heritage or race from your _Savant
Birthright_.

- Paranoid
- Emotionally cold
- Obsessed
- Vicious

Vitals

```
You have the same vitals as the original creature.
```

Savant Birthright

_Passive ability._
When you choose this race, you must also choose
a heritage from a different race. You are technically
of that race, and gain all of the associated aspects.
However, you will replace the abilities granted from
the race—not the heritage—with your choice of
abilities listed later in this section. For example, if
you chose Uline dwarf, you would keep the
Mountain-born ability, but lose the Hearty and Gruff
ability.
Upon picking a heritage, choose one ability from
the Physical & Mental Abilities section listed below,
and gain its tier 1 ability.
Then, if you wish, you may choose and gain one
of the conditions from the Physical and Mental

```
Conditions section listed below. If you do, you gain
the tier 2 ability for whichever talent you chose in
the earlier step, or a different tier 1 ability.
```

```
Physical & Mental Conditions
You may choose one passive ability from the
options listed below. If you do, you may gain a
second tier 1 ability, or the tier 2 ability of your
initial chosen ability.
```

```
Blind
Passive ability.
You are completely blind, and therefore cannot
see. You permanently have three levels of blindness.
```

```
Physically Disabled
Passive ability.
You use crutches or another device to aid your
mobility. Your movement speed is reduced by 40
feet.
```

```
Deaf and Mute
Passive ability.
You are deaf and mute. You cannot understand
anything more than simple ideas when people talk to
you, and you cannot talk back.
```

```
Physical & Mental Abilities
Choose an ability from this section and gain its
tier 1 ability. You can gain the tier 2 ability, or
choose a second tier 1 ability if you also take a
condition from the Physical and Mental Conditions
list above.
```

```
Te le pat h
Passive ability.
Tier 1: You can communicate telepathically with
any humanoid (or equally sentient creature) you
touch. While you are touching them, they can
communicate telepathically with you as well. You
```

may also sense using their senses, during which you
cannot sense through your own. Creatures are not
aware that you are sensing through them.
Tier 2: Your tier 1 abilities are not limited by
touch, and instead extend to a range of 20 feet.

Tr e m or s e n s e

_Passive ability._
Tier 1: By sensing vibrations in ground and air,
you can sense the location and shape of anything
within 20 feet of you, including through walls. This
counts as being able to see that object for the sake of
abilities that rely on sight. You cannot see color, and
details are limited to only things larger than your fist.
For example, you cannot read using this ability.
Tier 2: The range of this ability extends to 60
feet.

Futuresight

_Passive ability._
Tier 1: You have the Sight, and can see glimpses
into the future. Whenever you fall asleep or are
unconscious, you have a vision. Before you wake up,
you may ask the GM a question about an event in the
future. The GM must give a vague answer (generally
no more than a couple words), to the best of their
ability.
Tier 2: Your futuresight is more developed. Once,
at the beginning of each day, roll three dice of any
size you wish. Whenever you, the GM, or anyone
else rolls a die with size matching one of the dice
you rolled, you may replace the result with the result
from your die roll. After doing so, you cannot use
that die again.
