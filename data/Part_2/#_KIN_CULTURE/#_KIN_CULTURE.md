## # KIN & CULTURE

Minotaur

Minotaur are mighty, formidable creatures,
known for their powerful builds and no-nonsense
nature. Although most grow up in minotaur-
dominated communities, they have spread out across
Alaria, and can be found in great numbers in many
large armies.

Vitals

- Size: Medium
- Height: 6-7.5 feet
- Weight: 200-350 pounds

Minotaur Horns
_Passive ability._

The horns on your head count as a heavy
piercing melee weapon so long as you move at least
15 feet in a straight-line towards an enemy before
immediately attacking. You get one level of
advantage on your attacks made with your horns for
every 15 feet you charged before you attack. This
stacks up three times.

Danaki

Danaki are infamous for their toughness and their
terrifying rage. Danaki have no sense of family, as
the baby minotaur children are raised by the village.
Most do not know who their parents are, nor are they
interested in finding out. From a young age, they are
taught to fight and kill, usually long before they
learn how to read and write.
Danaki are also known for their rage—a berserk
state of anger and pure, single-minded aggression.
During a rage, they can behave unpredictably and
incredibly violently, and are capable of ignoring
many injuries.

```
Danaki are trained from a young age to express
very little emotion, and suppress it if possible.
Affection, joy, pain, and sadness are all viewed as
signs of weakness, and most claim that they have not
felt those things since they were a child. Marriages
in Danaki villages are arranged by the village
council once each member in the union has been
deemed “stable”. Most Danaki view their marriage
as a rite of passage to adulthood, a way of showing
that you have completed your growth. The marriages
are generally for convenience and pleasure, as many
aspects of emotion and family have been rooted out.
Although the Danaki inevitably grow attached to
one another, they admit it only in confidence, and
believe themselves capable of making decisions
completely unaffected by that attachment.

Aspects
```

- Show no weakness
- Obstinately bullheaded

```
Berserk
Major ability. Instant.
It is said that the Danaki rage is the physical
release of all the pent up emotions held within them.
Whether this is true is up to you.
Whenever you take damage, you may enter a
berserk state. While berserk, your movement speed
increases by 20, and increase every instance of
incoming and outgoing physical damage by 2. You
remain berserk so long as you make an A/D roll or
enter an engagement each round, up to a minute.
```

```
Lorean Minotaur
While Danaki may be a fast hire for a mercenary
crew, Lorean are more likely to be found as the
commanding general for a king’s army. In describing
the difference between Lorean and Danaki, it is most
famously quoted that “Lorean think with their head,
```

not with their horns”. Of course, if you ask their
spouses, they will say that they “think with their
head, not with their hearts”. This is the cursed
blessing of Lorean—incredibly tactically minded,
but seemingly incapable of thinking about problems
in any other way.
Lorean culture places a heavy emphasis on
education and sound decision making. To make a
mistake because emotions clouded one’s judgement
is worthy of profound shame. It’s not that Lorean
don't experience emotions—they do—but to let them
influence one’s decision at all is weakness and
failure, especially when other people’s wellbeing is
at stake.
This sense of duty towards protection lies as
deeply, if not more so, as their aversion towards
emotional decision-making. A Lorean who has been
placed in charge of his troop will die before letting
his troop get hurt. To fail in this would be the
ultimate failure as a minotaur—worthy of self-exile.
Although Lorean would never hold anyone else to
such high standards, including other minotaur, every
Lorean would never give such leniency to
themselves.

Aspects

- Profoundly caring
- Emotions get in the way of logical thinking

Tac t i c a l S u p r e m ac y
_Passive ability._
You may take an additional help action each
round. When you take the help action, you may
instead choose a willing creature within 30 feet and
move it 5 feet in any direction. This movement does
not provoke opportunity attacks.
