even if not knowledgable, of the world beyond the
brood. Etherweavers are also usually adept at
protecting their broods using magic, and therefore
require fewer goblins to protect, meaning that
etherweaver communities are much smaller, ranging
in the 10s to 100s. The smaller numbers leads to a
greater sense of individuality among the
etherweavers, and means that serving the brood is
less of a duty and more of a commitment to family.
The etherweavers who leave the brood usually go
on to become mystics and shamans, as their natural
affinity for the more non-basic elements gives them a
leg up over others, though etherweavers can be
found in nearly any other profession as wellâ€”having
elemental attunements can always come in handy.
