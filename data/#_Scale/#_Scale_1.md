# # Scale

There are two different scales that Heart Rush is
played at. The first is the moment-to-moment scale,
called micro-scale. This is the scale that combat and
conversations usually play out at. When a player
says what they want to do with their action in
combat, or describes or RPs the things they say to
another character, this is micro-scale.
The second scale is the macro-scale—when
actions are described more generically, and the
details don’t really matter. For example, when the
players say that they spend the rest of the night
hanging out with people from the inn, or when a
player says they want to spend the day hunting deer,
this is macro-scale.
The first half of this book describes how to
handle the micro-scale. Things you do either
succeed, or they fail, and there are strict definitions
for the outcomes of different activities you take.
Macro-scale is more nuanced and does not have the
same sort of strict rules for outcomes. In this section,
handling the macro-scale is described.

Macro-Scale

For the most part, macro-scale activities should
play out in whatever way makes the most sense and
would feel natural. However, when the macro-scale
action is one that has a specific goal and is risky or
has potential to fail, then you must use these rules.
Note that many times, activities that are risky or
have potential to fail are better suited to being played
out at micro-scale. For example, a conversation with
a duke to persuade him of new policy _could_ be
played out at macro-scale, if players would rather not
deal with the details of the conversation. However,

```
players may prefer to handle the situation themselves
on a more granular scale, in which case the
conversation should happen on a micro-scale. If
you're sure the activity should happen on a macro-
scale and the outcome is uncertain, proceed.
```

```
Running the Skill Check
Make sure players everyone is aware of what the
goal is, and make sure it's clear what a success state
looks like. This doesn't have to happen explicitly, but
it's usually safer to say it directly. If players are
going to fight off some thugs, and their goal is to
“win”, for example, this is not a clearly defined
success state. What does winning look like? Dead
thugs? Thugs that ran off? Thugs that are scared of
the players? Thugs that ran off and are scared of the
players? And does it matter if there are witnesses?
Once the success state is defined, you as the GM
should set and inform the players of the CN for the
roll. Then, the player can make a normal skill check
against the CN.
If the players roll 2 greater than the CN, then
they should be awarded a full success. If the players
roll somewhere between CN + 2 and CN - 2, the
players should get a partial success. And if the
players roll less, then it should result in failure. How
to run each of those outcomes is detailed below.
```

```
Full Success
When players achieve full success, they should
be able to achieve their goal, or at least have very
little work left to get there. Before or after this
moment of success, zoom in on a side effect from the
list below. Be specific.
```

Success, and

- you find something else useful or interesting
- you meet someone unusual or who might be
  helpful later
- you discover a secret
- you gain a valuable ally
- you find unexpected rewards or resources

Examples

- ** The player is foraging to get food ** : “An hour
  walk around the lake reveals little signs of food.
  However, as you near your starting location, you
  spot a small dark spot at the top of a nearby tree.
  Upon approach, it appears to be a cache of food.”
  When players investigate further, they also
  discover a crude map and some tools (unexpected
  rewards or resources).
- ** The player is doing daily musical
  performances to make money ** : “Your music is
  enormously popular in the city. Crowds gather, and
  you’re making about X (decide for yourself) ducat
  every day. After one, particularly impressive
  performance, a woman approaches you. She wears
  fine furs and her wrists and neck are dripping with
  silver and gold.” Upon conversation, the woman
  reveals herself to be someone looking for a
  musician for her upcoming, private party (unusual
  person/valuable ally).
- ** The player is visiting all the pubs, looking
  for blackmail on the king ** : “You hit a dozen pubs,
  being careful to ask the right questions so as to not
  raise too much suspicion. First, you learn that
  [insert blackmail about the king]. Second, you also
  noticed that one of the pubs you visited had a
  strangely high number of people who entered, and
  appeared to disappear inside. However, according
  to the owner there were many empty rooms.
  Wherever those people had gone, it wasn’t to their

```
rooms.” The location is a secret meeting place for a
covert faction (find something else interesting).
```

```
Part i al S u cc e s s
On a partial success, the original goal should still
be achievable, but there should be some final
obstacle or cost in the way. Before the player
achieves their desired goal, zoom in. Present the
options and outline the consequences.
```

```
Success, but
```

- it has a cost
- it requires getting into a situation
- it’s a worse version
- you disturb the status quo
- you will attract unwanted attention or suspicion
- people aren’t happy about it
- there will be consequences
- it will cost a favor
- it will cost a relationship
- it’s incomplete, or mixed with misdirection

```
Examples
```

- ** The player is selling their goods in a new
  city to make money ** : “You spend the day talking
  to vendors, looking for someone interested in
  buying your wares. As the day nears an end, you
  finally find someone who’s intrigued. He’s a
  peculiar looking fellow, with a brimmed hat, a long
  coat, and a pipe. You had been chatting with a
  representative at the guild and he had been
  listening from a seat nearby, and approaches you as
  you come out. ‘How do you do,’ he says, stepping
  up to shake your hand.” The man is willing to buy
  your wares, but he wants your help making amends
  with another merchant he burned his relationship
  with (it has a cost).
- ** The player is navigating a passage through
  the mountains ** : “The trip is slow but you’re

```
relatively confident that you know where you are.
However, around noon you come to a steep valley.
You don’t recognize this on your map, but you can
clearly see the lake you are trying to reach, only a
couple miles beyond. On either side of the valley,
you see burrows dotting the ground, each about 3
feet across. From where you stand at the foot of the
valley, however, all appears to be still.” Dangerous
creatures may emerge from the burrows if the
players travel through the valley (you will attract
unwanted attention or suspicion/it requires getting
into a situation).
```

- ** The player is mentoring a student to teach
  them how to run the ship in their absence ** : “The
  months stretch on, and Björn appears to be
  learning well. However, Björn is not popular with
  the crew. They think he’s a bit weak, and hasn't
  really proven his meddle, so they don’t want to be
  reporting to him in your absence.” Players may
  have to seek out a dangerous situation so that
  Björn can prove himself, or deal with later
  consequences of having an unpopular leader for
  their crew (people aren't happy about it).

Failure

On a failure, the original goal was failed.
However, there must always be some degree of
progression to throw the ball back in players’ court.
Describe the failure, and then zoom in on the silver
lining.

Failure, but

- you find something else useful or interesting
- you meet someone unusual or who might be
  helpful later
- you discover a secret
- you get clues towards where you can try again
- you gain a better understanding of the situation

```
Examples
```

- ** The player is recruiting villagers to defend
  the settlement ** : “Going from door to door, you beg
  the townsfolk to assemble—it’s their village they
  need to defend! However, your pleas are largely
  ignored, and except for a small ragtag group of
  idiots and misfits, nobody seems particularly
  interested in doing anything to stop the invaders.
  ‘New nobility, same taxes’ they say. However,
  while scouring the area for homes, you eventually
  spot a small shack on the hill. It is the last home
  around.” Inside is a crazy old man with insight on
  the nature of the attackers and maybe has ideas on
  defending the village (find someone unusual, better
  understanding of the situation).
- ** The players are beating up a pickpocket to
  teach them a lesson ** : “You grab the pickpocket by
  the back of the collar, and yank him back. With a
  yelp, the pickpocket wriggles free, sliding their
  shirt off and sprinting down the street before you
  can grab them again. You are left only with the
  pickpocket’s shirt. However, before you throw it
  away, you notice a small insignia of a leaping tiger
  embroidered in with gold thread, with the letters S
  V L underneath it.” This is the icon and insignia of
  the queen’s secret service of city spies (find
  something else useful/interesting, discover a
  secret).
- ** The player is trying to learn new spells at
  an academy for elemental mages ** : “A few months
  pass, and you are really struggling to pick up any
  of it. It’s mainly due to the fact that the professor
  for the class rarely shows up, and when she does,
  seems incredibly exhausted. One evening, while
  walking back to your dormitory, you see her across
  campus, limping from the forest.” She has come
  from some other adventure or commitment. If the
  players can solve her issues for her, she may be

```
able to actually teach the class (discover a secret,
clues towards trying again, better understanding).
```

Complication Triggered:

- A new danger is revealed
- You’re in a tough situation
- It had an unforeseen cost
- It isn’t as good as it seemed
- You aroused suspicion
- Dangerous forces are gathering
- The status quo is disturbed
- People aren’t happy about it
