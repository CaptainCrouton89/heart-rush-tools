## # TA L E N T S

only have a bloodoath against one creature at a time.
While you have sworn vengeance against a creature
you always know where the creature is, and
whenever you engage with or make an opportunity
attack against the creature you gain a rush point at
the beginning of the next round.

Destiny Level
You have advantage on A/D rolls against your
sworn enemy. In addition, you do not need to use
your action to use this ability.

Body Shield
_Heart ability. Martial talent._
The next time you are hit by a melee attack from
a source that is adjacent to both you and a creature
you are grappling, if the attacking creature’s stance
did not directly beat your own, you may use the
grappled creature as a body shield. Add the
creature’s defense bonus to your own and split the
damage between you, rounding up.

Destiny Level
You may use this ability against ranged attacks as
well, so long as the grappled creature is between you
and the source (a line can be drawn from one of your
corners to theirs that passes through the grappled
creature’s space).
When you use this ability, the grappled creature
takes all of the damage and makes the defense roll
instead.

Boundless Fury

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
Whenever your attack deals more damage than
the defending creature’s maximum heart die, you
may enter an engagement with a different, adjacent
creature immediately after the current engagement
ends. You cannot attack a creature you have already
attacked this round. After the new engagement, you

```
gain one level of weakened for each time you used
this ability in the round.
Destiny Level
Whenever you reduce a creature to 0 hit points,
your next attack roll deals an additional 1d10
damage.
```

```
Brutal Criticals
Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.
Whenever you roll the maximum result on any
two dice in an attack roll, you double each of their
values. Both dice must be a d6 or higher.
Destiny Level
This ability becomes a passive ability instead.
```

```
Bu nker Down
Heart ability. Martial talent.
You bunker down, preparing for the worst. You
may only use this ability if you have a shield. When
you bunker down, you gain the following effects
until the end of the round:
```

- You cannot dash, enter engagements, or make
  attack rolls.
- You must choose the defensive stance if
  someone enters an engagement with you.
- You may treat all defense rolls you make as
  their maximum result.
- When you are pushed, you are pushed half as
  far as you would be otherwise.
  Destiny Level
  You may bunker down as an instant ability, so
  long as you are not in an engagement in which you
  have already made an attack.

```
Burst of Speed
Passive ability. Martial talent.
You may choose to move 50 more feet this
round. If you do, you gain two levels of slowed at
the end of this round.
```

Destiny Level
So long as you end your movement on the
ground, you can run on walls and ceilings while
using this talent. Additionally, you don’t provoke
opportunity attacks from creatures you pass, so long
as you do not pause or interact with the creature
while within its melee range.

Careful Shot

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
If you didn’t moved in the previous round and
have not moved yet during this round, you may
apply two levels of dazed, off-balanced, or weakened
with your ranged attacks. Your range is doubled, and
you ignore levels of cover less than total cover.

Destiny Level
You may instead apply two levels of each
condition.

Charge

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
Whenever you move 20 feet or more in a straight
line towards an enemy and immediately engage them
with a heavy melee weapon, if you make an attack
roll against them, they fall prone. For every 20 feet
of distance you charge, you may add an additional
1d6 to your attack, up to 3d6 damage. The enemy
must be no greater than one size larger than you to
use this ability.

```
Destiny Level
Add d10s to your roll, rather than d6s.
```

Clinger
_Passive ability. Martial talent._

You have advantage on checks to climb and hold
on to other creatures, and an additional level of
advantage on attacks against creatures you climb on.

```
Destiny Level
You gain A2 instead for each of those rolls.
```

```
Clobber
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you make a melee attack against an
enemy that is adjacent to a wall, heavy shield, or
other piece of impassable terrain, add 1d4 to your
attack roll.
Destiny Level
Add 2d4 to your attack roll instead. They gain
two levels of weakened.
```

```
Committed Blows
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever your stance perfectly beats the target
of your attack (might vs cunning, agility vs might,
cunning vs agility), add 1d6 to your attack roll.
Whenever your stance is perfectly beaten, subtract
1d6 from your defense roll.
Destiny Level
Add or subtract 2d6 instead.
```

```
Critical Observation
Major ability. Martial talent.
You may spend a minute examining a creature to
try to identify a weakness in a creature’s defenses.
Make an observation (cunning) skill check contested
by 8 plus the creature’s defense bonus. On a success,
you get AD2 on all attack rolls against the creature.
On success or failure, you cannot attempt to
make another critical observation about that creature.
Destiny Level
You may instead make the skill check contested
by 12 plus the creature’s defense bonus. On a
success, you get AD4 on all attacks against the
creature instead.
```

```
Cruelty
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever a creature within 10 feet of you takes
damage, you may increase that damage by 1.
```
