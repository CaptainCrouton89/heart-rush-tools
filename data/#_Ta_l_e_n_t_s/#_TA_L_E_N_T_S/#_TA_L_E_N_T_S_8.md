Befuddle
_Heart ability. Handmagic._
As an action, you may point at a sentient
creature. That creature forms no new memories for
the next ten minutes, though it is aware that you
performed mind-altering magic on it.

Destiny Level
The target does not realize that you performed
mind-altering magic on it.

Beastform
_Major ability. Handmagic._
When you pick this talent, work with your GM to
pick a common and mundane creature that you can
transform into. As an action, you may transform into
this creature. You maintain your mental stats, though
take on the physical stats and abilities of the chosen
creature.
The creature can not have a fly speed or a swim
speed, and should use either a d4 and d8, or two d6s
for its might and agility ability dice. It must be either
a small or medium creature. It has the same
maximum hit points and heart die as you do.
You automatically revert to your natural form
after one hour, or as an action any time before then.

Destiny Level
This becomes a passive ability. You may stay in
your transformed state for any amount of time. The
creature you transform into may be tiny, and may
have a swim speed. The creature can have 2d8s, or a
d4 and d10 for its might and agility dice.

Call of Delorn
Monthly ability. Gaeic melody.
You play a song, making a plea to the wilds for
their help. After playing your instrument for an hour,
a friendly, non-humanoid animal comes to your aid.
The animal is not your servant, but will do its best to
help you in any way that does not put itself in
danger. You may communicate with it through your
song, though the animal cannot communicate back.
```

The animal remains in your aid for the rest of the
day.

Destiny Level
You may choose for a sentient creature,
including other humanoids, to answer your call
instead. They feel a strong compulsion to help you
for reasons they cannot identify, so long as you do
not drive them away with your words or actions.

Cast Thoughts

_Passive ability. Handmagic._

choose to allow them to.

thing about them that they aren’t trying to hide from
the following list:

- Profession - Childhood - Moral compass
  If you wish, you may press further and make a
  presence check contested by their cunning challenge
  number. This check is made with disadvantage if
  they are unfriendly or hostile towards you. On a
  success, you learn any one specific piece of
  information that the target knows and is not actively
  hiding. On a fail, they know that you are fishing for
  information about your topic.
  Destiny Level
  You do not make this check with disadvantage
  against unfriendly creatures, and you make the check
  with advantage if it’s against a friendly or neutral
  creature. In addition, if you fail, the creature does not
  know that you were probing for details on your
  topic.
