- Your bed counts as a straw bed for the purpose
  of calculating odds of a successful night of sleep.
  Destiny Level
  You may choose each option more than once, to
  grant additional levels of advantage on navigation
  checks, or give other people the benefits of shelter
  and a straw bed.
  Additionally, you have finely tuned your sense
  for where there may be more to discover, and what
  you might find. Once per month, while exploring a
  location unfamiliar to you, you may declare that
  there is more to be discovered. Then name either
  ruin, settlement, or natural wonder, and choose a
  direction that you have not been in before. Whatever
  you named is located somewhat closely in the named
  direction. The GM may ask you to choose a different
  direction, or a different discovery.

they disappear in one hour. They use a d4 for all
ability dice, a d6 heart die, and immediately
disappears if they take any damage or negative
effects. They may be dispelled any time earlier as an
action. The servant requires no food, water, or sleep,
but can only obey simple commands, and must

The servant remains indefinitely. You cannot
have more than one servant alive at any time. You
may take this destiny level again to increase the
maximum number of servants at your disposal by
one.
