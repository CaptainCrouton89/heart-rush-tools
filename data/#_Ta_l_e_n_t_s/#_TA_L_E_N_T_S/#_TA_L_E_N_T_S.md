Ballad Of Björn
_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._

After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, you may choose any number of creatures
besides yourself within 60 feet and in earshot. They
lose all levels of frightened and charmed if they had
any, and are immune to both conditions for the next
24 hours.
In addition, they gain the benefits of a short rest,
and gain one additional rush point the next time they
gain rush points today.

Destiny Level
This ability becomes a major ability. You may
include yourself in the creatures affected by your
song.

BattleFrenzy

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
While there are two or more enemies adjacent to
you, you have advantage on your attack roll for each
enemy adjacent to you.

Destiny Level
Whenever you start the round with two or more
enemies adjacent to you, you gain a rush point for
each adjacent enemy.

Battlescreech

_Heart ability. Martial talent._
You emit a horrifying, earsplitting screech,
terrifying and disturbing your enemies. Choose any
number of creatures within 30 feet. Those creatures
get D2 on their next A/D roll.

Destiny Level
Those creatures also don’t gain the benefit of the
next stance they choose, and gain two levels of

Battleweave
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you sidestep, you deal damage to an
adjacent creature at your new location equal to twice
the number of enemies you began the round adjacent
to.

Beast Bond
Passive ability. Handmagic. Prerequisite: Beast Companion
You can magically, telepathically communicate
with your companion, and over any distance.
As an action, you may begin sensing through the
senses of your beast companion. You cannot use
your own senses again until you spend an action
returning to your own body.
Destiny Level
As an action, you may take total control of your
beast companion. While in control, you play each
round as the animal instead of yourself. You may use
any cognitive and martial talents you have, but the
cooldowns are not separate for your animal. For
example, once you've used a major ability, you
cannot use it yourself or as your animal until you
take a long rest. You may also cast spells you know
and use your attunements as the animal.
While controlling your companion, your body
falls prone and is incapacitated, and you cannot
sense using your body’s senses. You may return to
your body as an action.
```

Beast Companion
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
Choose an animal with the GM’s approval. It has
a d6/d4/d2/d2 stat block, must be of small size or
smaller, has 20 hit point capacity, and a d6 heart die
(you may work with your GM to adjust these
values). You can communicate simple ideas with it
from a distance using verbal and somatic commands.
The animal obeys all your commands.
When in combat, your companion is not very
effective on its own. Your companion cannot use its
action to enter engagements, though it can still be
forced into engagements by other combatants. It can
otherwise use its action normally.
You may take this talent any number of times.
If your companion dies, you may choose to
replace this talent with another talent instead.

Destiny Level
You may spend XP on your beast companion as
though it were yourself. Beast companions cannot
gain talents as oaths, and cannot gain cognitive
talents. Your beast companion cannot gain a beast
companion.
While adjacent to your companion, if you or your
companion would be forced to make a defense roll,
the other may choose to step in to make the defense
roll and take the damage instead. If that creature was
already being attacked from the same source, they
cannot use this ability.

Beckon
_Heart ability. Handmagic._

bring up to two creatures besides yourself when
using this ability.

enemy that has taken a wound, you may give it three
