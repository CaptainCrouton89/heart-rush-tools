## # TA L E N T S

Destiny Level
When you use this ability, you may cast the spell
as a priority ability this round without using your
action.

Exert
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
Whenever you make an attack roll, you may add
2d6 to the roll. If you do, decrease your heart die by
one size after making your attack roll.

Destiny Level
You may add 4d6 instead. If you do, decrease
your heart die twice instead.

Fast Friends
_Heart ability. Handmagic._
Choose two creatures besides yourself. They
have D2 on attack rolls against each other for the
next 10 minutes.

Destiny Level
Instead, only one of those creatures of your
choice has disadvantage on its attack rolls.

Feint

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
Once per round, when you sidestep, you may
instead choose to feint and remain stationary. If so,
choose an adjacent creature. When you do this, you
gain A2 on your next A/D roll made this round
against that creature.

Destiny Level
You may use this ability three times per round.
When you use it a third time in a round against the
same creature, you do not have to remain stationary.

First Strike
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
Whenever you make an attack roll against a
creature with hit points equal to its hit point capacity,

```
add 1d6 to your attack roll. If you are the very first
person to enter an engagement in an encounter, you
may make an opportunity attack.
Destiny Level
When you use this ability, the target creature
takes your choice of three levels of dazed, weakened,
or off-balanced.
```

```
Fling
Passive ability. Instant. Martial talent.
When you choose the might stance and make an
attack roll against a creature you are grappling, you
may instead choose to fling the target. Make a might
ability check contested by the creature’s might or
agility challenge number. On a success, you throw
the creature a number of feet equal to 5 times the
difference, and the creature falls prone. You may
choose to fling them directly to the ground so that all
the forced movement turns into damage instead.
Destiny Level
They instead fly a number of feet equal to 7
times the result of your might check, rounded down.
```

```
Focused
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
Rather than losing all of your rush points at the
end of a round, you may keep up to three.
Destiny Level
You may keep up to five, instead.
```

```
Frenzy
Major ability. Cognitive talent.
For the next minute, treat this talent as an
additional minor ability, with its own separate cost.
Whenever you use this as a minor ability, choose one
of your minor abilities and perform that effect. At the
end of the minute, you gain a level of weakened, off-
balanced, and dazed for each time you used this as a
```

minor ability. These levels do not fade until you take
a long rest.

Destiny Level
Each time you use this as a minor ability, roll
your heart die and regain that many hit points.

Fury
_Passive ability. Martial talent._

While below 0 hit points, you may roll an
additional die in your attacks equal to your current
heart die.

```
Destiny Level
You may roll it an additional two times instead.
```

Gambit
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
You may declare a non-defensive stance before
everyone reveals (allowing other people to change
theirs in response). Anyone who attacks you has D2
on their defense rolls during this engagement. You
have advantage on your attack roll.

Destiny Level
You have A2 on attack rolls instead, and may add
1d6 to your attack roll.

Grasping Growth
_Major ability. Handmagic._
You cause plants to grow up from the ground,
clutching at the legs of those above. Chose a point
within 45 feet. Creatures of your choice within 5 feet
of that point gain two levels of restrained. They may
break free by succeeding in a might check contested
by your heart challenge number.

Destiny Level
You may increase the radius by 25 feet, increase
the levels of restrained by one, or increase the
difficulty of the check by two.

```
Hands of the Healer
Weekly ability. Handmagic.
You may spend one minute with your hands on
another creature with a wound, automatically
treating that wound and reducing its rank by 5.
Destiny Level
You may use this ability as an action, rather than
spending a minute to perform the ability. Remove all
ranks of a single wound instead of just five.
```

```
Haphazard
Passive ability. Martial talent.
You may treat 1s in your attack and defense rolls
as 6s instead.
Destiny Level
Treat them as 12s instead.
```

```
Harass
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you enter an engagement with one or
more enemies that are adjacent to a wall or another
piece of impassable terrain, you may choose one of
those creatures. That creature cannot take the
sidestep action until the end of the next round, and if
that creature attacks anyone besides you in that
engagement, you may make an opportunity attack
against it.
Destiny Level
The opportunity attack does not cost an action.
```

```
Hit ‘Em Where It Counts
Passive ability. Martial talent.
You may forgo any number of levels of
advantage on an attack roll to instead get +1 to your
attack roll for each level you forgo.
Destiny Level
If you have advantage on an attack roll, you gain
an additional two levels of advantage.
```
