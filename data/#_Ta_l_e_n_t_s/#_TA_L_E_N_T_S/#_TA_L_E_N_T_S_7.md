Whipmaster

creature until the end of the round. Whips you use
are treated as light weapons rather than ultralight
weapons.

than one size larger than you. It takes 1d6 damage if
it falls prone.

Whirlwind Strike

When you make an attack roll against an enemy
using a melee slashing weapon, you may make the

unoccupied object or space within 30 feet. Up to a 5-
foot cube worth of volume of that object becomes

object, they must use their action to step free of it,

Freeing oneself from the slime requires a CN 12

You may touch an object to see its past. Choose
one:

  when it was surrounded by the most excitement
  and activity.
- Recent: You see the events around the last time
  the object was touched by another creature.

  truthfully.

```
At t r action

attract each other with 50 pounds of force if they are
within 10 feet of each other. The effect lasts until you

attractive force begins at 100 feet away. If you use
this ability on the same objects every day for a
month, the effect becomes permanent.
```

```
Assembly Not Required
Passive ability. Handmagic.
Any of your body parts may be detached and
reattached to their original positions at will, without
damaging them. You may control all of your body
parts at will.

lost, you cannot identify your location only by
looking at the stars, though a successful navigation
check will tell you that you are lost.
