Smell Something Fishy
_Heart ability. Cognitive talent._
When investigating the location of a mystery or
crime, you may ask the GM if there are any
undiscovered clues related to a question of your
choice about whatever event occurred in your
location. The GM must answer truthfully.

Destiny Level
When investigating a mystery or crime, or when
interrogating a suspect, you may posit a hypothesis
about what happened to the GM. Then, the GM rolls
a d4 in secret. On a 2, 3, or 4, the GM must nod their
head if you are right, and shake their head if you are
wrong. On a 1, the GM must do the opposite.

Stargazer

_Weekly ability. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, if you can see the stars, you may
use this ability. You may ask one yes or no question
about the past or present.
The GM will do their best to answer your
question.

Destiny Level
You may instead use this ability to ask an open
ended question with a one-word answer. Roll 1d10.
On a 8, 9, or 10, the GM must answer truthfully with
one word.

Tw o-Faced

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
You have two faces, your natural face and a
second face with features you decide, which you can
switch between by passing a hand over your face.
The second face is always the same face. It requires
an action to perform this ability.

Destiny Level
Your face can change to any face you’ve seen
before when you use this ability.

Voice Actor
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
You gain the following abilities:
```

- You can imitate voices nearly perfectly.
- You can produce any sound you have heard
  before, so long as it is within your normal vocal
  volume.
  A CN 12 cunning check will reveal imperfections
  in your imitation.
  Destiny Level
  You gain the following additional abilities:
- You can speak and produce sound without
  moving your mouth or lips.
- You can throw your voice up to 15 feet.
  The CN for identifying your mimicry increases
  to a 14.

```
Waltz of the Weissenkauer
Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.
You play a macabre and sinister tune. After
playing your instrument for a minute or more, all
creatures within 60 feet and in earshot gain one level
of frightened towards you for the rest of the day.
Destiny Level
You may choose for them to gain three levels of
frightened instead, and you may choose to exempt
creatures from the effects.
```

```
Wor ldly Tr av e le r
Monthly ability. Cognitive talent.
You have traveled the world and met many, many
people. When you meet someone who the GM
describes as someone you’ve never met, you may
choose to claim some connection to them. If you do,
the GM will explain how you recognize them, and
the nature of your connection. This connection may
be as distant as “you saw them drinking in a bar in a
neighboring country”, or as close as, “this woman
bears a strong resemblance to the thief you killed
```

earlier today, and you suspect she is his sister”. It is
possible there is no feasible connection between you
and this person. In this case, you may either regain
the use of this ability, or take three destiny points.
You cannot use this ability to claim connections with
people more influential than yourself.

Destiny Level
Rather than claim a connection to someone you
meet, you may use this ability before actually
running into someone. For example, while at a bar in
a foreign country, you could claim that you knew a
weapon enchanter who lived in this area. If the GM
also believes this to be plausible, your connection
becomes real (though their location and condition
may have changed since the last time you talked with
them). If the GM doesn’t believe this to be
reasonable, you may choose not to use this ability.
