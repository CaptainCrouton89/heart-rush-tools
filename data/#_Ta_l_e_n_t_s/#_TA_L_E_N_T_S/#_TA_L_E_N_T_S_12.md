## # TA L E N T S

Medic
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
You have advantage when making cunning
checks to treat wounds or perform first aid.

```
Destiny Level
You have A3 instead.
```

Memories Fading
_Weekly ability. Handmagic._

You may alter the thoughts and memories of a
non-hostile creature that you touch. You may replace
up to one minute’s worth of memories made by that
creature from the last ten minutes with whatever
memories you wish. You gain 3 levels of dazed until
you take a long rest. They are unaware of any magic
occurring.

Destiny Level
You may instead replace one hour’s worth of
memories from the last day.

Metallurgy
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Earth._
Add iron and steel to your resonate substances as
a basic solid attunement.
Whenever you are hit with a melee weapon made
of iron or steel, you may catch the blade in your
hand, warping and bending it in your grip. Do not
roll a defense roll—you take the full damage—but
the weapon is rendered useless, and cannot be used
again.

Destiny Level
If you have a paragon attunement to earth, you
gain an advanced attunement to iron and steel.

Misty Illusions

_Passive ability. Cognitive Talent. Elemental attunement: Water & Air._
You can manipulate the water in the air to create
realistic illusions. Add mist to your resonate
substances as a liquid attunement.

```
As an action, you may make an illusion of a
single object within the range of your mist
manipulation. The illusion cannot be seen through,
and creatures will not realize that it is an illusion
until they have interacted with it in some way, at
which point the illusion fades from their sight.
Illusions can be hidden behind if the illusion is of
another object, though they appear as three
dimensional objects, so they cannot be illusions of
darkness, empty space, or your immediate
surroundings.
If a creature has reason to suspect it is an
illusion, such as if something suddenly appears or
disappears, they may make a cunning check
contested by your cunning challenge number. On a
success, they see through the illusion.
Destiny Level
By agitating the molecules in the air, you can
also cause the illusion to emit realistic sounds of
your choice. You may manipulate the image and
sounds as an object interaction.
```

```
Nature’s Child
Passive ability. Handmagic.
You can sense basic intentions and communicate
simple ideas with wild animals. When you take this
talent, you may choose to limit this ability to only
one type of animal, such as ravens, spiders, or
wolves. If you do, those creatures will never attack
you and you have A3 on all interactions with those
creatures.
Destiny Level
As an action, you can summon forth wild
animals in a mile radius. If you have chosen a
specific animal, you gain exclusively that animal
instead.
```

Necromancy
_Major ability. Handmagic._
You can raise the dead. By sacrificing a creature,
you can reanimate another creature of the same type.
The ritual takes one hour, and at the end you have a
creature with stats identical to the dead creature, with
the same might die, d2 cunning, agility, and presence
dice, half of the hit point maximum, and no ability to
communicate. It loses any special combat abilities it
had, and obeys any orders you give it to the best of
its ability. You can have no more than one undead
creature under your control.

Destiny Level
You may create and control up to three undead
servants with this talent.

Observant
_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
You have A4 on cunning checks to notice things.
In addition, so long as you can see someone’s
lips and understand the language they are speaking,
you know what they are saying, even if you can’t
hear them.

Destiny Level
Hidden attackers cannot make opportunity
attacks against you, you do not suffer any penalty
from attacking an obscured enemy, and obscured
enemies gain no advantage when attacking you.
In addition, if you spend your action watching a
creature fight for three rounds or more, you learn the
creature’s strengths and weaknesses, and have
advantage on all A/D rolls made against that
creature.

Oracle
_Monthly ability. Full action. Handmagic._

As an action, you may choose a creature other
than yourself. That creature’s next roll is replaced
with the maximum result on each of the dice, and a

```
complication occurs. At any time, the GM may
replace any one of your next rolls with the minimum
possible result. It cannot be rerolled or replaced. The
GM may not do so again until you use this ability
again.
Destiny Level
This no longer takes an action.
```

```
Pinky Swear
Passive ability. Handmagic.
While the smallest finger of your hand is
interlocked with the smallest finger of another
person’s hand, neither you nor that person can
knowingly utter a lie.
Destiny Level
While your fingers are intertwined, both people
are compelled to speak truthfully. They cannot
withhold information.
```

```
Poisoner
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
So long as you can disguise it as another action,
you automatically succeed on any check to slip
poison into someone’s food or drink, even while in
plain sight of them. This does not guarantee that they
will not notice there is poison in their food, only that
they will not realize that you are poisoning the food
as you do it.
For every 10 times you digest a single type of
poison, you develop a slightly higher tolerance for it,
and take 10 damage less from every instance of
damage it deals.
Destiny Level
You know your poisons. You immediately know
if any food or drink you eat contains any poison, as
well as all of its properties.
```
