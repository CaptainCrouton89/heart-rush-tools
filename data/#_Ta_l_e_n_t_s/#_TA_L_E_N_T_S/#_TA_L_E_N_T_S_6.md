Destiny Level
The healing is equal to the full amount spent,
rather than being halved.

Savage Attacker
_Passive ability. Martial talnt._
Whenever you push a creature back with a heavy
weapon using the might stance, they take 1d8
damage for every 5 feet of movement blocked by a
wall, rather than 1d6.

```
Destiny Level
This damage increases to 1d10 instead of 1d8.
```

Searing Blood

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
Your blood is infused with eldritch power.
Whenever you take a wound, whatever creature
wounded you loses hit points equal to one tenth of
your maximum hit points.

Destiny Level
The creature loses hit points equal to one fifth
instead.

Shield Master

_Passive ability. Martial talent._
You have learned how to attack with your shield
and use it as a proper weapon itself. Your shield
counts as a light bludgeoning weapon. If you would
push a creature while attacking with your shield, the
target is pushed 5 additional feet.

Destiny Level
You may choose to hunker behind your shield, to
increase your defenses. When you take the defensive
stance, you take one fourth as much damage, rather
than half.

```
Shifty
Passive ability. Martial talent.
If you use your action to initiate or enter an
engagement, once everyone has entered the
engagement who wishes to, you may choose to
sidestep before stances have been declared. You may
do this once per round.
Destiny Level
If you would sidestep such that you cannot be
attacked by anyone in the engagement, you regain
your action.
```

```
Slippery
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you make a skill check or saving
throw to try to physically dodge a trap or an area
effect, you may choose to first sidestep and fall
prone.
Whenever you make a skill check or saving
throw to avoid or escape being restrained, you may
choose to replace the result of either die with its
maximum, after rolling.
You cannot be grappled.
Destiny Level
Once per round, if you roll doubles on a defense
roll, you may immediately sidestep. If you are no
longer a valid target for your attacker, you do not
take damage.
```

```
Staggering Blows
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you roll the maximum on one of the
dice in your attack roll, the defending creature takes
three levels of off-balanced.
Destiny Level
The target is also knocked prone so long as it is
no more than one size larger than you. If it is, instead
add your weapon die to the attack an additional time.
```

Still Fresh
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
If you are at your maximum heart die size, levels
of dazed, off-balanced, and weakened fade twice
rather than once.

Destiny Level
Enemies cannot inflict upon you the dazed, off-
balanced, or weakened conditions while your heart
die is still at its maximum.

Su ndering Blows
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
Whenever you make an attack roll with the might
stance, using a heavy melee weapon against
someone who chose the cunning stance, you may
choose to permanently decrease the defense bonus
from their armor by 2, to a minimum of 0.
If the armor is natural, the penalty lasts until the
creature heals all of its wounds. If it is physical
armor, then the armor requires repairs before it can
work effectively again.

Destiny Level
Creatures you hit with this ability can have a
negative defense bonus.

Ta k e A dva n t ag e

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
Whenever an enemy has two or more levels of
weakened, dazed, or off-balanced, or has two or
more conditions affecting it, you have A2 on your
attacks against them.

Destiny Level
You instead get a number of levels of advantage
on your attack rolls equal to the total number of
conditions affecting the defending creature, or the
maximum number of levels of any one condition the
creature has, whichever is greater.

```
Ta r g e t t h e W e a k n e s s
Heart ability. Instant. Cognitive talent.
After entering an engagement, but before anyone
declares stances, you may use this ability. Announce
a stance, and a creature in the engagement. Once
stances are revealed, any attack roll against the
creature made using the announced stance ignores
half of the target’s defense roll.
Destiny Level
Ignore the creature’s entire defense roll instead.
```

```
Ta u n t i n g B l ow
Passive ability. Martial talent.
Whenever you make an attack roll with the
cunning stance against someone who chose the
agility stance, you may choose to give them two
fewer conditions and instead give them a level of
enraged towards you.
Destiny Level
You may choose to also forgo making an attack
roll to instead give them three levels of enraged.
```

```
Th row e r
Passive ability. Martial talent.
You can throw light weapons.
Destiny Level
You can throw heavy weapons.
```

```
Tu m b l e
Major ability. Instant. Martial talent.
When you choose the agility stance, you may
sidestep before those who chose the cunning stance
attack, potentially allowing you to avoid an attack.
Destiny Level
Whenever you sidestep in this manner, you may
add 1d8 to your next attack roll in the current
engagement.
```
