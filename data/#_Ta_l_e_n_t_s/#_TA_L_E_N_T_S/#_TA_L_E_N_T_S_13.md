## # TA L E N T S

Rapid Growth
_Major ability. Full action. Handmagic._
As an action, you may place your hand on a non-
living object that fits in a space somewhere between
a 10-foot cube and a 2-inch cube. The object grows
to fill a 10-foot cube, or shrinks to fit a 2-inch cube,
though it will not grow if it is enclosed. The
transformation lasts for one hour, or until dismissed
as an action.

Destiny Level
The transformation lasts indefinitely, though you
may not use this ability on more than three different
objects at once. The upper limit of the size increases
to at 25-foot cube.

Repulsion

_Heart ability. Cognitive talent. Elemental attunement: Force_
Choose any two objects. Those objects repulse
each other with 50 pounds of force if they are within
10 feet of each other. The effect lasts until you
choose two new objects.

Destiny Level
You may choose up to 5 objects, and the
repulsive force begins at 100 feet away.

Rope Servant

_Passive ability. Handmagic._
If a single piece of rope is held in your hands, it
can be controlled in any way you wish, as if it were
an extension of your arm, including floating straight
up. It is not strong or dexterous enough to wield a
weapon. The control persists only while you hold the
rope. The rope can be of length up to 50 feet.

Destiny Level
The rope becomes unbreakably strong while
being held, and it can extend up to 200 feet long.

Ru nescribe
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
If you have aspect 4 or higher in runescribing or
a similar aspect, you may now begin making
handmagic signs. If you spend a week studying and
practicing with a sign that you can readily see, you
can memorize that sign and tattoo hands with that
sign in the future. It requires 1 oz of titan blood and
titan bone, which equates to about half the price of
getting a new handmagic sign.
Destiny Level
If you have aspect 5 or higher in runescribing or
a similar aspect, you may make the additional
modifications to a handmagic sign to make its
destiny level upgrade. You must spend a week
studying and practicing before memorizing and
inscribing the destiny level version of a sign.
```

```
Silver Tongue
Major ability. Handmagic.
As an action, you may charm a person you are
talking to. They gain 2 ranks of charmed towards
you for the next hour, after which they know they
were magically charmed by you. They lose all ranks
of charmed if you take a hostile action towards them.
Destiny Level
The effect lasts twelve hours rather than one. The
person does not realize they were charmed when the
effect ends.
```

```
Siren’s Song
Weekly ability. Gaeic melody.
After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, all creatures within 60 feet and in earshot are
enthralled with your performance, and struggle to
pull their gaze away. So long as you play and they
are not in obvious danger, they will approach you up
to 10 feet, and will not pull their gaze from you.
```

They have D3 on checks to notice their
surroundings.

Destiny Level
The range of your song increases to 120 feet. In
addition, you may choose to exclude individuals
from the collection of creatures you enthrall.

Smooth Talker

_Passive ability. Cognitive talent._
Whenever you speak, your words come out like
smooth butter. You have A2 on presence skill checks
to persuade, intimidate, and deceive.

Destiny Level
When you gain this destiny level, choose
persuasion, intimidation, or deception. Whenever
you make a skill check in that category, before you
roll, you may choose to instead use the maximum
result of your presence die rather than rolling.

Song of Rage

_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._
After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, you may choose a creature within 60 feet and
in earshot. It feels an inexplicable dislike towards a
creature of your choice. If they were close, they
become neutral. If they were friendly, they become
unfriendly. If they were neutral or unfriendly, they
become hostile, and potentially violent. This effect
lasts for the rest of the day.

Destiny Level
That creature gains three levels of enraged
towards that creature until the end of the day.

Song of Desire

_Weekly ability. Gaeic melody._
After playing your instrument for a minute or
more, you may choose a creature within 60 feet and
in earshot. It feels an inexplicable amiability towards
a creature of your choice. They cannot willingly

```
attack that creature unless that creature acts with
hostility towards it. If they were hostile, they become
neutral. If they were unfriendly, they become
friendly. If they were neutral, they become close.
This effect lasts for the rest of the day.
Destiny Level
That creature gains three levels of charmed
towards that creature until the end of the day.
```

```
Song of Rest
Monthly ability. Gaeic melody.
After playing your instrument for an hour or
more, creatures that can hear you gain the benefits of
a successful long rest.
Destiny Level
Those creatures gain the benefit of two long
rests, instead.
```

```
The Spider
Passive ability. Cognitive talent.
You have a network of spies and informants at
your fingertips. Once per day while within a city
within the range of your influence, you may meet
with your informants to learn what is going on
around town. You may ask two unique questions of
the GM. If you meet with them again after a day or
more, your spies return with answers. The GM
answers one of your questions truthfully, and either
gives false information about the other, or else
doesn’t answer it at all. Any information that fewer
than 25 people know about cannot be answered by
your spy network.
Destiny Level
You may ask up to three questions, and may ask
questions with answers that are known by no fewer
than five people. The GM must truthfully answer
two of the three questions.
```
