# # Ta l e n t s

Talents represent specific abilities you have
learned, been gifted, or know how to perform
through religious or magical ritual.
Each talent will fall into one of three types of
abilities: passive abilities, heart abilities, or major
abilities. As with abilities gained from your class,
passive abilities can be used whenever and at no
cost, and major abilities can be used once per day.
Heart abilities, in contrast, can be used again only
after you have taken a short or long rest, or if you
take a wound.
Additionally, talents may also have the _instant_ or
_full action_ tag. If it is _instant_ , then you can use the
ability at literally any time, even right before you
roll. If it has the _full action_ tag, it requires you to use
your action.

Ty p e s o f Ta l e n t s

Several varieties of talents exist, indicated by
their tags. Each require different conditions to be met
in order to gain that talent.

Cognitive and Martial Talents

Martial talents are those that require physical
prowess and training. They represent the cumulation
of extensive practice and training. There are no
prerequisites for taking a martial talent.
Cognitive talents, like martial talents, come from
vigorous training and practice. Likewise, there are no
prerequisites for taking a cognitive talent.

Gaeic Melodies
Gaeic melodies are fragments of song that
reverberate throughout all living things—left over
from when Gaea the Earth Mother sang the world
into life.
Gaeic melodies are magical, and listening to
them have magical effects. However, they cannot be
discovered innately, and require a teacher or a
songbook. In addition, you must have a rank 3 or
higher aspect in musical talents in order to play
them.
When playing a gaeic melody, it requires your
action to play the instrument. You can move up to
half your move speed while playing, but cannot
move more than that. You cannot play more than one
gaeic melody at the same time.

Handmagic
Handmagic uses the power of Deoric to create
their effects. Deoric is the language of truth—where
words spoken in it simply come true.
Handmagic uses Deoric runes tattooed on the
back of one’s hand, inscribed in the blood of magical
creatures to power this life-cost. By articulating the
tattooed hand in specific ways, one can then create

GM Note
Gaeic melodies and handmagic are rooted in
lore specific to “Alaria”, the world held in mind
during the writing of the Heart Rush rulebook.
Feel free to re-flavor these tags, remove them, or
add new tags and categorizations.

those magical effects. The knowledge and necessary
materials to inscribe hand runes is rare and
expensive, and will cost a hefty fee, and likely
require you to be in a city.

Combat Talents

The talents in this section are combat-related
talents. This categorization is for the ease of finding
talents, and has no other effect.

Adrenaline Spike
_Major ability. Handmagic._

Increase the size of an ability die for a single roll.
You can't increase the size of the die beyond a d12.

Destiny Level
Increase the size of the die by two instead, or
increase a d12 to a d20.

Agile
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
When you choose the agility stance, you may
sidestep twice instead of once.

Destiny Level
Whenever you choose this stance, if you declared
this stance the previous round, add 1d6 to all A/D
rolls made this round. Increase the die’s size by one
for each consecutive time you chose this stance.

Assassin
_Passive ability. Martial talent._
You have learned the art of debilitating your foes
and killing them silently. When you enter an
engagement with a humanoid, you may immediately
make a might or agility check against their agility
challenge number. On a success, you either gag
them, garrote them, or in some other way remove
their ability to speak or shout out. They cannot

```
produce sound for the next minute. If the creature is
surprised, you automatically succeed at this check.
Destiny Level
Once per month, you may declare a humanoid to
be the target of your assassination. So long as that
creature never learns you are an assassin, they
remain marked.
Given you spend one month studying the target
of your assassination before attempting to kill them,
you have A5 on opportunity attacks made against
your target, and advantage on all other attacks
against it.
```

```
Back Stab
Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.
If you and another ally are opposite to each other
with an enemy directly between you (you can draw a
line from a single corner of your space to every
corner of the ally’s space such that the line passes
completely through the enemy’s space), and the
enemy has used its action to enter an engagement
with your ally this round, you may treat your weapon
as using a d20 for your next melee attack roll against
that enemy until end of the round. You must be
wielding an ultralight melee weapon to gain the
benefits of this ability.
You may also use this die if you are granted an
opportunity attack because you are hidden.
Destiny Level
You may replace your weapon die with 2d20
instead.
```

```
Baited Attack
Heart ability. Instant. Martial talent.
If a creature makes an attack against you and
deals no damage to you, they instead deal damage
equal to their roll to another creature behind you as
you redirect their attack. A creature is considered
behind you if at least one straight line can be drawn
```
