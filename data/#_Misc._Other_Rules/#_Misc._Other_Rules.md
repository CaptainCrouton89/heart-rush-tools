# # Misc. Other Rules

Le a r n i n g a La n g u a g e

With structured, high quality lessons, learning a
new language will take from six months to a couple
years, depending on the complexity of the language.
When you wish to learn a new language, the GM
will select a difficulty for that language. That is the
number of successes you need on monthly cunning
checks to become fluent in that language (generally
6–30). It takes half that number of successes to have
a passable proficiency, and a quarter of that number
to understand the most basic words and phrases. The
difficulty of those cunning checks depends on the
circumstances under which you are learning the
language. Use the following table to calculate the
difficulty.

Other Long Term Tasks
Whenever you wish to take on a multi-day task,
especially if it will take months or even years, you
can use the following framework to determine
progress. Examples of this would include crafting
custom armor, recruiting an army, converting people
to a religion, and building a boat.
The framework is as follows. The GM should
first determine the timeframe of checks. This could
be days, weeks, or months. Then, they should
determine the absolute minimum amount of these
time-blocks that would be necessary to complete the
task, given the best possible circumstances. Lastly,
they should set a CN based off of your specific
circumstances. You may roll against this CN once as
each block of time passes by, so long as you spend
that time working towards your long term goal.

Quick Combat

Extensive rules for full combat are laid out in the
next chapter. However, there are times when it is
clear that you will defeat your opponents easily, and
using the full rules for combat can be more trouble
than it’s worth. If this is the case, you may want to
use these quick-combat rules.
The party should place the outcomes in the
following list in order of priority, with the most

important outcome at the top of their list. Then, a
player must roll a might, agility, or cunning skill
check four times, contested by a CN set by the GM
representing the difficulty of the encounter. For each
failure, the failure outcome on the lowest priority
item occurs, and then that item gets crossed off the
list. If the number rolled is less than half of the CN,
then the epic failure results occur instead. If the

outcome occurs.

  wounds.
