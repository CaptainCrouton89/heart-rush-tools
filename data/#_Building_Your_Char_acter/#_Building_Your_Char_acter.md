# # Building Your Char acter

As you make a character in Heart Rush,
remember that at the center of every Heart Rush
character is their heart. It is the foundation on which
you build your life, your soul; it is the chassis and
essence of your decisions and their consequences;
and it is what drives you forward. You are building
an entire, fictional person. Make them awesome.

You r D r e a m

With this in mind, build a character that has a
vision towards what they want to achieve. You
should have a dream of what you want to do in the
world, one that is complex and difficult and worthy
of the caliber of legend you wish to become.
Remember—you determine the direction the story
takes. There’s no goal to this game besides the one
you set for yourself. So speak with your GM about
the world in which the game takes place, and figure
out how you want to be remembered. It’s your story,
and the stakes are low, so it’s okay to set your sights
high.
Once you have come up with something, write
this dream down somewhere. You may want to edit
or add to it later.

You r V i t al s

These are the core-most stats of your character.
They represent the raw capabilities and limits of
your mind and body.

```
Experience
When the game begins, you will start with some
experience (XP). During the game and between
sessions, you may spend XP to gain new skills,
abilities, and more. See the Spending Experience
section to learn more. After making your character,
you may begin spending your XP.
```

```
Ability Dice
Players have four important stats—might, agility,
cunning, and presence. These traits define your
physical and mental abilities, and are used to
determine the outcomes of nearly any difficult task
you attempt to do.
```

```
Might
Might is your strength, endurance, and fortitude.
High might allows you to push through locked doors,
lift heavy gates, resist poison, and run for miles
without rest.
```

```
Agilit y
Agility is your physical dexterity, speed, and
reflexes. High agility allows you to dodge falling
rocks, respond to threats faster, and perform a
summersault on a tightrope.
```

```
Cunning
Cunning is your intellect, wisdom, and senses.
High cunning allows you to recall information
you’ve learned, notice the nearly imperceptible, and
discern fact from fiction.
```

Presence

Presence is your charm, charisma, and social
influence. High presence allows you to persuade
guards to let you past, lie to them about why you did
it, and then intimidate them into not telling anyone
about it.

Assigning Dice to Your Core Stats

Your prowess in each of these abilities is
represented by a die. Whenever you attempt a task
that requires one of these abilities, you will roll the
ability’s corresponding die and add it to the result.
The first step in creating your character is
determining which dice you will use for which stat.
Typical humanoids use d6s and d4s for each ability,
reflecting a general mediocrity at most things. When
you create your character, assign a d6 to two of your
abilities, and a d4 to the remaining two.

Movement

By default, you have a 60 feet move speed. That
means that when you take the dash action (see the
Combat section), you can cover that distance. Note
that your move speed is negatively effected by
equipment penalties (like armor).
When swimming, you have a swim speed of 15
feet. This is also negatively effected by equipment
penalties: don’t swim with heavy armor on.
When climbing, your move speed is 5 feet. This
is not affected by equipment penalties.

Health

The health of your character is represented by a
combination of your hit points, heart die, and
wounds. In combat, you will lose hit points and take
wounds. As you exert yourself, your heart die will
fall, making it harder to avoid losing hit points and
taking more wounds. Eventually, if you take too

```
many wounds, you may bleed out and die. Each of
these systems will be explained further in the
following sections.
```

```
Hit Points
Hit points represent your physical health.
Damage causes your hit points to fall by a
corresponding amount. As they fall, you come closer
to death. When you create a character, you start at 40
hit points. If your hit points ever reach 0, you can
choose to immediately go unconscious. If you don’t,
you go unconscious after 10 minutes if your hit
points are still at 0.
Your hit points can go negative as well. If your
hit points are ever equal to the negative equivalent of
your maximum hit points, you die.
When you take a long rest, your hit points return
to their maximum.
```

```
Heart Die
Your heart die represents your stamina. It
manifests itself when you roll dice to perform
challenging actions. With very few exceptions, this
die will be part of every roll you make. When you
create a character, it starts at a maximum of a d8.
Other creatures can have larger or smaller heart
dice. A rat, for example, will only have a d4 heart
die, while an adult dragon would use a d20. It is
possible to increase your own heart die beyond a d8,
but it requires a lot of XP and is challenging.
Sometimes, there will be effects that cause your
heart die to increase or decrease. This means
replacing your heart die with a die of a larger or
smaller size. For example, decreasing your heart die
from a d8 would mean replacing it with a d6.

Wou n ds
When you take damage in Heart Rush, it can
mean different things depending on how much
damage you take. If it’s less than 10 damage, this
