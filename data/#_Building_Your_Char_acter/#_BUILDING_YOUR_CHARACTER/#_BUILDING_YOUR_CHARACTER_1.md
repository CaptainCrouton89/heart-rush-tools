## # BUILDING YOUR CHARACTER

```
Example
Let’s say you have the aspects “Diplomat” at
rank 2, and “I need revenge for my family” at
rank 3. You have just met the queen and are
trying to convince her that civil war is imminent.
When you make the skill check to convince her
of this truth, you spend 3 DP to increase your roll
by 3, successfully convincing her. However,
moments later you find out that the queen herself
was complicit in your family’s murders. The GM
invokes you aspect for revenge—you gain 2 DP,
but must now exact revenge, or else be forced to
pay 2 DP instead.
```

aspects. For example, “Kleptomaniac" could be used
as a bonus to rolls to steal, but you could gain DP for
invoking it at times when it really would be best _not_
to steal. You could even use both at the same time—
such as when stealing something you shouldn’t.
You’d gain DP when you decide to try to steal it, but
then could immediately spend the same amount to
gain a bonus on taking it.

Wou n ds

When you take wounds, they will have a
description and a rank, just like an aspect. You may
use wounds as aspects as well, though you cannot
gain more than 5 DP from invoking the wound, even
if the rank of the wound is higher. For example, if
you have the rank 12 wound, "Guts spilling out,”
you could gain 5 DP by taking a minus 12 penalty to
nearly any athletics check, since it'd be logical that
having that type of wound would make it very
difficult to do almost anything physical.

Progress

```
There are six different ranks of combat power
you can start at in Heart Rush. With each rank, you
have access to more combat abilities. When you first
start to play, everyone should agree which rank to
begin the game at. At rank 1, players are barely more
than commoners with a desire for excitement; at rank
4, players are incredible combatants, likely known
throughout their community; and at rank 6 and
beyond, players are at low heroic levels; with
everything else falling somewhere in between.
```

```
At each rank, you gain new abilities. If you are
starting at a rank higher than rank 1, gain all the
abilities from each previous rank, and start with XP
equal to the corresponding value in the row.

Combat Ranks, Classes,

Subcl asses, & Paragon Levels
While you will gain XP every session, you
progress in combat ranks at the GM’s discretion. In
general, you should expect to graduate to the next
combat rank around when you have an amount of
total XP corresponding to the respective rank, as
