Advice for New Groups
If everyone in your group is brand new to
Heart Rush, rank 0 is a good place to start.
There are many rules that only kick into play
once you have a class, and Heart Rush combat
can take some time to wrap your head around,
so it can be nice to start small.

GM Note
When determining when to grant players the
next combat rank, itâ€™s generally a good idea to
wait until a suitably impressive fight has been
won by the party. These combat ranks are major
upgrades in player combat power, so they act as a
great reward for players accepting and defeating
more dangerous fights.
