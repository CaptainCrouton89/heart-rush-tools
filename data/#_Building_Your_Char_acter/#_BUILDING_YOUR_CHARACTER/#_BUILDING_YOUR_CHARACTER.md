## # BUILDING YOUR CHARACTER

represents minor injuries—nothing that poses a real
threat. However, if you take 10 or more damage, this
represents something serious—a wound. The exact
details of taking wounds and healing them will be
described later in the Combat section.

Your Niche

Kin & Culture

Everyone comes from a different background and
has a different upbringing. When you create a
character, choose a race from the Kin & Culture
section. You gain the aspects and abilities that come
from choosing that race.
Many races have multiple heritages within that
race. In that case, you gain the aspects and abilities
of the race, as well as a those of a chosen heritage.

Ta l e n t s

Talents are specialized abilities that you know
and can utilize. These act as a way of specializing
your play style and differentiating you from anyone
else in the world. Although you do not start with any
talents, they can be purchased with XP, with which
you start the game and can immediately use to buy
talents.

Background

Your background describes your past life and
skills. Choose up to three professions and distribute
4 ranks between them. They can all be in one, or
they can be spread between them. Whenever you
make a skill check that one or more of your
professions would apply to, add your rank in the
relevant professions to that roll.

```
Aspects
For every facet of your character that cannot be
described with abilities and skills, they can be
described with aspects. Your aspects describe the
features and traits from your personality,
background, and experiences that make you distinct
—both positive and negative.
When you first create your character, you gain
three destiny points (DP). You will gain and lose DP
each session as you spend them to benefit from your
positive aspects and gain them by letting your
negative ones shine through. If you ever start a
session with fewer than three DP, you instead start
with three DP. You cannot have more than 10 DP.
As you play your character, you will gather more
aspects, and their impact will grow. Each aspect has
two parts: its description, and its rank.
```

```
Description
The description describes the aspect as a whole,
and should be a phrase or a few words to describe
your character. It should be a significant personality
trait, behavioral quirk, belief, ideal, self-proclaimed
title, or some sort of reputation. For example,
“Bullheaded,” “Record everything,” “Chronic
headaches,” “Kleptomaniac,” “Fortune teller,”
“Leave no one behind,” “I fear nothing,” “I can see
straight into your soul” and “I want revenge for my
father” can all be aspect descriptions. Do not choose
generic things, like “good at most thing” or “lucky”,
```

```
Example
Let’s say you choose “Diplomat” and “Tutor
for Nobility” as your professions, and distribute 3
ranks to the first, and 1 rank to the latter. If you
were making a skill check to persuade someone of
something, you could add 3 to that roll due to your
background as a diplomat.
```

since they will apply to everything, or be too vague
to decide if they should apply to a situation. If the
GM says your aspect description is too generic, you
need to choose a new one, or make it more specific.

Rank

Next, the aspect gets a rank. The rank of an
aspect represents how influential that aspect is over
who you are, and will determine the modifier to your
rolls. The rank will be a number between one and
five, though in some cases it can be increased even
further.

Using Your Aspect for Bonuses

By spending destiny points up to or equal to an
aspect’s rank, you may add that much to any skill
check. In order to use this, whatever roll you are
making must align with the meaning of your aspect,
as approved by the GM.
For example, if you had the aspect “Leave no
one behind” at rank two, and you were trying to save
a friend stuck in prison, you could spend two DP and
add 2 to a die roll made to break open the bars of the
cell.
Or, for example, if you had the aspect “I want
revenge for my father” at rank four, you could spend
four DP and add 4 to any skill check that was related
to getting revenge for your father.
If you have multiple aspects that apply to a roll,
use only the highest ranking aspect that applies.

Using Your Aspect for Destiny Points

In contrast, if an aspect would complicate a
situation or indicate you were bad at something, you
may choose to do whatever your aspect would
suggest and gain destiny points equal to the aspect’s
rank.
“Bum leg,” “Kleptomaniac,” and “Quick to draw
my sword” are examples of negative aspects. If you
role-play an aspect such that you invite risk, then the

```
GM will award DP. For example, if a bookstore
owner insults you, and you have the aspect “Quick to
draw my sword” at rank three, you would gain three
DP by drawing your sword and threatening the shop-
owner.
Likewise, if you were chasing after a fleeing
thief, rather than making a skill check to keep up
with them, you could choose to fail the roll, citing
your bum leg and taking DP corresponding to the
rank of the aspect.
```

```
Creating Your Aspects
When you create your character, create two
aspects. You will gain two more from your race and
culture and you may gain more throughout the game.
All aspects start at rank one when they are created,
unless noted otherwise. No aspect can be greater
than rank five.
When creating an aspect, it is generally a good
idea to have aspects with both positive and negative
sides to them. Without any negative aspects, you
have no way of gaining more destiny points, and
therefore cannot spend them on bonuses. Also look
out for aspects that can be both positive and negative
