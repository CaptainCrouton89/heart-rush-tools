Advanced Character Creation
Sometimes, you want an even more in-
depth character creation process. If this is
something that interests everyone in the group,
check out the advanced character creation rules
in the Advanced Character Creation section.

```
Burn Through Those DP
To get the most out of your character, you
should be invoking your aspects frequently. DP
are not meant to be a precious resource—spend
them, and then make more by invoking your
negative ones. When creating your character,
make sure to create aspects that you’re going to
enjoy using; you’ll be using them a lot.
```

outlined in the table above. However, it is ultimately
up to the GM.

Rank 0

At this rank, you have no special abilities beyond
those that you purchase with your XP.

Rank 1

When you reach rank 1, you will have to choose
a class, as listed in the Classes section. Your class
will determine what role you have in combat—
tanking heavy blows, dealing damage, or supporting
your teammates. You are welcome to do whatever
you want in combat, but your class will give you an
edge in its respective role. Mark down all of the
abilities for that class that are at or below rank 1.

Rank 2

Upon reaching rank 2, you will have to choose a
subclass. Each class has a few subclasses, which are
specializations of your class. You must choose one of
them. Mark down all of the abilities for your class
and subclass that are at or below rank 2.
Additionally, at this stage you must decide if you
wish to become spelltouched. Spelltouched are a
universal subclass specializing in using elements to
deal damage. You can read more about them in the
Spelltouched section.

```
Rank 3
When you reach rank 3, you unlock more
abilities in your subclass. Mark down all of the
abilities for your subclass that are at or below rank 3.
```

```
Rank 4
At rank 4, you unlock the last abilities from your
subclass. Mark down all of the abilities for your
subclass that are at or below rank 4.
```

```
Rank 5 and Above
Finally, upon reaching rank 5, and for each rank
thereafter, you gain a paragon level. When you gain
```

```
a paragon level, you may choose and gain an ability
from the Paragon Abilities section. These abilities
represent heroic level capstones to various combat
archetypes.
