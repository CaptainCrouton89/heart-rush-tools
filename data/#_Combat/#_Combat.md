# # Combat

Combat occurs in rounds, broken up by abilities
and engagements. Engagements are short scenes of
combat between participants, and are used to abstract
the actions of multiple combatants all trying to attack
each other.
During each round, everyone will have the
chance to use whatever abilities they can and take
actions, though the order of all these things can vary
from round to round. There are not “turns” in the
traditional sense.

Starting Combat

When combat begins, everyone loses priority.
That means they cannot use abilities that are not
_instant_. Instead, priority will be granted to a starting
side, and then pass back and forth until everyone in
the round has done all of the things they want to do.
The first step is determining who starts with
priority. If one side wasn’t expecting to get attacked,
the other side gains priority and should choose
someone on their side to start. If both sides saw
combat coming, the players should roll 1d6 to
determine which side gets starting priority, with a 4
or higher resulting in the players getting priority
first. The starting side will begin each subsequent
round with priority.

Priority During Combat

When your side in a fight has priority, anyone on
your side can use an ability. Once they do, priority
passes to the other side. If they don’t want to use an
ability (or can't), priority passes back to your side.

```
This continues until neither side wishes to do
anything, in which case the round ends. Note that
abilities with the instant tag do not require priority,
and do not trigger priority passing to the other side.
In overview, the sequence will look like this:
someone on the side with priority will use an ability.
Once that ability resolves, anyone on the other side
can choose to use an ability next. If nobody on that
side wants to, then anybody on the original side gets
another turn. If none of them want to do anything, it
passes to the other side one final time. If all of them
still don’t want to use an ability, then the round is
over.
If, however, someone does want to use an ability,
then the sequence starts over. In effect, so long as
both sides are frantically trying to use their abilities,
both sides will alternate using abilities. However, if
one side is no longer interested in or able to use any
abilities, the other side will be able to
uninterruptedly continue using abilities until the
other side decides to jump back in.
During engagements, which are explained in the
Engaging the Enemy section, nobody gets priority.
As soon as someone enters an engagement, neither
side has priority until the engagement ends.
