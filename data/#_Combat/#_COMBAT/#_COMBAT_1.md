## # COMBAT

Minor Abilities

Minor abilities are special abilities unique to
your class and subclass. Whenever you use a minor
ability, you must spend one rush point for each time
you’ve used the ability, including the current use.
You have multiple minor abilities, so you will have
to manage how many times you’ve used each
separately. They do not require you to spend an
action, but there may be limitations on when you can
use them.

Major Abilities

Major abilities are like ultimate moves your
character has. Unlike minor abilities, major abilities
can only be used once per day. Major abilities gained
from your class have additional, optional rush point
costs, meaning that your major abilities will get
stronger and stronger the longer the fight lasts. They
do not require you to spend an action, but there may
be limitations on when you can use them

Special Use Cases

Rush points can also be spent to make
opportunity attacks or to sidestep.

Engaging the

Enemy

An engagement with the enemy may be a short
flurry of crossing blows, or it may be part of a larger
melee with dozens of combatants.
In either case, when you first decide to engage
the enemy—taking the _Engage the Enemy_ action—
choose an enemy you could theoretically hit with the
weapon you are currently wielding. You and this
enemy are now part of the engagement. The enemy
does not have a choice in entering this engagement,

```
and participating in this engagement does not cost
them their action.
As an engagement has now begun, creatures no
longer get priority. The engagement must be resolved
before creatures get priority again. However, first,
other creatures get a chance to join.
Other creatures within weapon range of anyone
in the engagement may decide to enter the
engagement as well. If they wish to do so, they can
spend their action to join the engagement. This is the
Enter an Engagement action.
```

```
Choosing Stances
Once everyone who wants to and is allowed to
join the engagement has done so, every combatant
within the engagement must secretly choose their
stance: might, agility, cunning, or the defensive
stance. Once everyone has chosen, everyone must
reveal their choice. Attacks proceed in a manner
similar to rock paper scissors, as outlined in the
sections below.
Note that if the players wish to discuss which
stance to choose among themselves, the GM should
choose the stance for the enemies before the players
decide for their characters, to prevent any
accusations of cheating by reacting to the decisions
made by the players.
```

```
Ty p i c a l R o u n ds
In most rounds, you’ll want to move a bit—
the first dash is free—and you’ll want to start
or enter an engagement, since that’s the main
way to deal damage. Sprinkled throughout,
you’ll use various abilities and occasionally
you’ll want to do something else with your
action, but moving and engaging is the gist.
```

Cunning

Those who chose cunning are able to easily read
and avoid the attacks of anyone who can’t beat them
with raw strength, and get to make an attack against
a single creature in the engagement that didn’t take
the might stance. Creatures that chose the cunning
stance make their attack rolls first, in any order.
Cunning directly beats agility. Whenever you use
this stance to attack a creature defending with the
agility stance, you may apply up to two levels of
dazed, off-balanced, or weakened to that creature.

Agilit y

Those who chose agility are able to maneuver
their way past those who can’t read their actions, and
get to make an attack against a single creature in the
engagement that didn’t take the cunning stance.
Creatures that chose the agility stance can make their
attack rolls after all of the cunning stance attack rolls
have been made.
Also, if you choose this stance, you may take the
sidestep action for free during the engagement, right
before or after you make your attack. Creatures that
choose to attack before moving get to attack before
creatures that sidestep and then attack. If creatures
on opposite sides of a fight get to move via the
agility stance, both sides should alternate who
moves, starting with whichever side was originally
engaged with.

Might

Those who chose might are able to crush those
who are not agile enough to get out of the way, and
get to make an attack against a single creature in the
engagement that didn’t take the agility stance.
Creatures that chose the might stance make their
attack rolls last.
Additionally, whenever you attack a creature
defending with the cunning stance, you trigger your

```
weapon’s might stance bonus. Check out the
Weapons section to learn more.
```

```
Defensive
Anyone who chose the defensive stance does not
get to attack, but will not take as much damage.
After subtracting your defense from an attack, halve
the remaining damage, rounding up.
```

```
Resolution
After everyone has revealed their stance, it is
time for attacks. Everyone may attack one other
character that their stance beats, and is within range
of their weapon. All stances beat defensive stance. If
no one else took a stance that they could beat, or
they aren’t in range of your weapon, you cannot
attack in this engagement.
Attacks should happen in order of
1.Cunning
2.Agility
3.Might.
Starting with cunning, anyone who chose the
cunning stance may choose to attack each other or
anyone who chose the agility or defensive stance.
Proceed in order.
Although attacks of the same stance may not
literally happen simultaneously, treat them as though
they did. For example, if you push a creature away
with a melee weapon using the might stance, it
cannot prevent them from attacking a creature that
they were previously in range of hitting with the
might stance. Likewise, if the attack would kill them,
they still get to hit another creature first.
Note that if an attack pushes a target before the
target's stance goes, such as if a cunning attacker
pushed someone who had chosen agility, the target
might not be in range of anyone any more, and
would be unable to attack or be attacked during the
subsequent turns for the remaining stances.
