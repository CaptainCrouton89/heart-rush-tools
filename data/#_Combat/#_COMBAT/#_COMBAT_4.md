## # COMBAT

Depending on the circumstances, the GM may also
choose for the creature to immediately die instead.

Cover

Cover is an important part of staying aliveâ€”if
you remain behind cover, you remain safe from
ranged enemy attacks. There are three different types
of cover, based on how many lines of sight exist
between the attacker and the defender. Determining
what type of cover you have from an attacker can be
done by drawing imaginary lines between any one
point on the attacker and each corner of a square that
the enemy takes the space of. For each line that is
obstructed by an obstacle, the attacker gets a level of
disadvantage on their ranged attack roll. If all four
lines are blocked by solid objects, you cannot attack
that creature.
Sometimes, obstacles do not lend themselves to
the line blocked method of determining cover. It is
then up to the GM to decide how much cover should
be awarded to the defender. Usually, anything small
but not very helpful like a small tree in the way of
your shot will provide one level of cover. Things that
the defender has to poke their body out from behind
to attack, such as the rise of a hill, or back of a
couch, provide two levels of cover. Lastly, things
that are specifically designed for uni-directional
attacks, such as arrow slits, will provide three levels
of cover.
