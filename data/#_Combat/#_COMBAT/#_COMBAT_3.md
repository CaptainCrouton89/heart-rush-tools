## # COMBAT

```
Example
You are at 25 hit points, and have a d6 heart
die. You lose an engagement and they are going
to deal 30 damage. This won’t kill you, but it’ll
put you below 0, meaning you’d go unconscious
after 10 minutes. You don’t want this, so you
instead choose to decrement your heart die, going
down to a d4. Instead of 30 damage, you take 15,
going down to 10 hit points. Then, because you
took over 10 damage, you take a wound. The GM
tells you that that your leg is badly smashed. You
write down “Smashed leg: 15”. That’s going to
suck.
```

unconscious. If you do not, you fall unconscious
anyway after 10 minutes. If you take damage while
at or below zero, continue to mark that damage and
any wounds—you can go into the negative.
If your hit points ever reach an amount equal to
or less than the negative of your maximum, you die.
Once you are unconscious, you remain
unconscious so long as your hit points are zero or
fewer.
You can recover hit points and reduce wounds by
taking rests. Read more in the Rests & Healing
section.

Other Offensive

Act ions

If you want to do something to an enemy other
than hit it with a weapon, such as grapple it, climb
onto it, or otherwise mess with it, it still begins with
winning an engagement. However, you must win the
engagement by directly beating their stance—both
choosing the same stance does not let you perform
these types of acts. Assuming you have directly
beaten their stance, you may forgo your attack roll
and instead use one of these other options. If you do,

```
the effects of the offensive action occur after all
attack rolls have been made.
Some of these options requires a contested skill
check, rather than an attack and defense roll. These
contested checks still receive advantage or
disadvantage as though they were an attack or
defense roll of their corresponding ability, but they
should not use any additional dice (such as from
your weapon) or bonuses from armor.
```

```
Grappling
Make a might ability check against an adjacent
creature, contested by the creature’s own might or
agility ability check. If either creature is larger, it
gets a level of advantage on their roll for each level
of size difference.
If you roll higher, the creature is grappled. You
gain the condition grappling and the opposing
creature gains the condition grappled.
Unless otherwise specified, at least one hand
must be free to grapple another creature. You can
grapple with one or two hands. If grappling with
```

```
Example
You want to grapple an adjacent wolf before
it moves past you and attacks your badly hurt
friend. You enter an engagement with it, choose
stances, and stances are revealed. You chose
cunning, and it chose agility. Since cunning beats
agility, you get to attack. However, since you’re
trying to grapple it, you decide not to attack, and
instead make a might check. Your ally used the
help action earlier in the round, so you have
advantage. The wolf makes an agility check to
avoid getting grappled, but it rolls less than you.
The wolf is now grappled, and you are now
grappling. The wolf is stuck.
```

```
Why Would I Go Unconscious??
If you’re in a nasty fight, combatants tend
to try to attack the people who are still fighting
back. If you go unconscious, people usually
won’t view you as a threat, so you’re a lot less
likely to be attacked (and potentially die).
Things trying to eat you generally don’t abide
by this, so in some cases this is definitely not
recommended...
```

only one hand, halve your grapple ability check,
rounding up.
A creature can only be grappled by one creature
at a time, and can only grapple one creature at a
time.
While grappling a creature, rather than pushing
the creature when you use the might stance, you may
choose to instead deal 1d6 damage, plus 1d6 damage
for every size greater you are than the grappled
creature.

Climb On

Choose an adjacent creature two or more sizes
larger than you. Make a might or agility ability check
contested by the creature’s might or agility ability
check. If you roll higher, you climb onto the
creature. So long as you are on the creature, you
have the _creature climber_ condition. Likewise, the
climbed on creature has the _climbed on_ condition.
A creature can only climb on one creature at a
time.

Hinder

When you choose this option, you perform some
other sort of option that interferes with your target.
This could be represented by throwing sand in their
eyes, kicking out their legs, or sucker punching
them. You must be adjacent to the creature you target
with this ability.
Choose one option from the following list:

- The creature takes 1d4 damage and 2 levels of
  weakened, off-balanced, or dazed.
- The creature takes 1 level of blinded.
- The creature is knocked prone so long as it is
  no more than one size larger than you.
- Push the creature 5 feet. It travels 5 feet less for
  every size larger than you it is, and 5 feet more for
  every size smaller. The creature gains 2 levels of
  off-balanced.

```
Stunt
Choose your own effect, with the GM’s
permission. This could be something like stealing an
item from around the creature's neck, grabbing their
sword by the blade to turn it into clay, trying to taunt
the creature by patting them on the head, or swinging
into the creature from a rope to knock it off its feet.
In these cases, make a contested ability check
against the creature.
```

Special

Circumstances

```
Surprise
In some cases when combat begins, one or more
parties will be completely surprised, giving anyone
who was already prepared to fight a large advantage.
Special rules apply in these circumstances.
A creature is not surprised if they can see their
opponent before the round begins, and they are
unfriendly or hostile towards their opponent or don’t
know their opponent.
If one of the parties in an encounter is completely
surprised by combat, then each un-surprised creature
can use their action to make an opportunity attack,
and each surprised creature does not get to use
abilities or move on the first round of combat.
```

```
At tacking t he He lple ss
Sometimes, you will make attacks against
creatures that are completely unable to defend
themselves. At the GM’s discretion, you may make
an opportunity attack against the creature.
