## # COMBAT

```
Engagements Are Important
Engagements are the core of Heart Rush
combat, and they might take a bit of time to
wrap your head around. There’s a whole
section (Engaging the Enemy) on it, but the
idea is that you’re entering a chaotic melee
where anyone could get hurt, including
yourself.
```

During Combat

During each round of combat, you can take up to
one action, and use any number of abilities
(following the frequency restrictions on the abilities
themselves).

Act ions

You get one action per round. All actions are
abilities, and as with all abilities, you must have
priority to use them.
Note that the _Dash_ action, _Object Interaction_
action, and _Call Out_ action do not cost an action the
first time you perform them each round.

Engage the Enemy
_Full action._
As an action, you may engage with the enemy.
This does not guarantee that you’ll injure them, or
even hit them in the first place. In fact, they might hit
you instead.
Rules for engagement are complicated, and are
described in detail in the Engaging the Enemy
section below. As a simple analogy, using your
action to engage the enemy can be described as
initiating a rock-paper-scissors game of combat with
the enemy, with the victor having the chance to
injure the loser.

Cast A Spell
_Full action._

See the Spellcasting section for details and
restrictions on casting spells. You cannot cast a spell
if you do not know any spells.

Sidestep
_Full action\*._
Rather than using an action, you may instead
spend a rush point to perform this ability.

```
When you take this action, you may move 5 feet
or stand up from prone. This movement does not
provoke opportunity attacks.
```

```
Dash
Full action*.
The first dash you take each round does not cost
your action.
Move a number of feet up to or equal to your
move speed. Unless stated otherwise, your move
speed is 60 before accounting for equipment.
If you move more than 5 feet within a creature’s
melee range or leave their melee range without
taking the sidestep action, the creature may make an
opportunity attack against you. Resolve the attack
before leaving the creature’s range and completing
the movement.
```

```
Object Interaction
Full action*.
The first object interaction you take each round
does not cost your action.
Any sort of simple interaction with an object
counts as an interaction action. Stowing a weapon
and retrieving a new one are two separate object
interactions.
```

```
Help
Full action.
You aid another creature. Choose an adjacent
creature. That creature gets advantage on its next A/
D roll, skill check, or saving throw.
```

```
Call Out
Full action*.
The first call out you make each round does not
cost your action.
Say (or shout out) something. Up to one,
reasonable-length sentence.
```

Instant Actions

Below are some actions that you can take at
instant speed, even while another creature is doing
an action. They do not trigger priority changes.

Enter An Engagement

_Full action. Instant._
As an action, you may enter an engagement that
has already been initiated between other characters
but has not yet begun. Unlike other abilities, you do
not need priority to use this ability. Instead,
immediately after someone uses the _Engage the
Enemy_ action, everyone has the choice to take this
action until nobody else wishes to do so.
There must be a valid target in range of your
weapon who is already part of the engagement in
order to enter. To continue the analogy from the
explanation of engaging the enemy, this is like
deciding to jump into a rock-paper-scissors game
going on between the people around you, and
choosing to play as well.

Tr i p

_Full action. Instant._
Whenever a creatures with a level of off-
balanced moves (willingly or forced) through a space
that is adjacent to you, if that creature is no more
than one size larger than you, you may trip the
creature, immediately knocking it prone in that
space.

Opportunity Attack

_Full action\*. Instant._
Rather than using an action, you may instead
spend a rush point to perform this ability.
Opportunity attacks represent moments when an
enemy has presented an easily exploited weakness.
They let you make an attack against them without
first winning an engagement.

```
You can only take this action if one or more of
the following conditions is met:
```

- The enemy willingly leaves your melee reach
  without using the sidestep ability.
- The enemy willingly moves more than 5 feet
  within your melee reach without using the sidestep
  ability.
- The enemy stands up without using the
  sidestep action.
- You are hidden.
- The target of your action is surprised.
  When you take this action, make an attack roll
  against the creature with the stance of your choice.

```
Rush Poin ts
Rush represents the excitement and tension of a
fight. As a fight goes on, rush points build, and you
can perform more and more powerful moves. Rush is
represented with a pool of points. At the start of
combat, you have one rush point. At the beginning of
each subsequent round, you gain rush points equal to
the number of rounds in which you were part of an
engagement, made an opportunity attack, or cast a
spell, up to the current number of rounds. Other
abilities may increase this pool further.
Unspent rush points are lost at the end of every
round.
Outside of combat, you have 0 rush points.
```

```
Hard To Get, but Great
Opportunity attacks are like gold. They’re
hard to get, but when you do, you can throw
everything you’ve got into the roll and nail the
target exactly the way you want. For this
reason, enemies will do a lot to avoid getting
hit with them. Use that to your advantage.
```
