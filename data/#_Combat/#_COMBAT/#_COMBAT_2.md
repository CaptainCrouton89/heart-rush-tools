## # COMBAT

At tacking

If you get to attack someone, you make an attack
roll consisting of your heart die + ability die for the
stance you chose + weapon die. Then, the defending
creature makes a defense roll using their heart die +
ability die corresponding to the stance you chose +
armor bonuses.
After both sides roll, the defender then takes
damage equal to the the result of the attack roll
minus the defense roll. If this would be negative, the

```
defender instead takes no damage. See the next
section to determine how damage is dealt with.
Note that if you are attacking someone who is
attacking you back with the same stance, make
contested attack rolls rather than two separate attack
and defense rolls.
Anyone can attack someone who takes the
defense stance. Make contested rolls as normal, but
the resulting damage is halved.

Example
You initiate a fight, and dash towards the undead orc in front of you. Priority passes to the enemies. The
orc’s undead wolf dashes, coming adjacent to you as well. Priority passes back to you and allies. Your ally
decides she wants to shoot the first orc with an arrow, announcing she’s entering an engagement. Since an
engagement has started, nobody can use abilities that aren’t instant now.
You decide to join the engagement, since you can attack the orc too. The undead hound joins the
engagement as well. The orc is already in the engagement, so it doesn’t have to use its action to join.
The engagement begins. You coordinate with your archer ally—you’ll choose might, she’ll choose
agility. You announce you’re ready, and stances are revealed. The orc chose might, and the hound chose
cunning. Time to resolve attacks.
1.Cunning happens first. Although cunning beats agility, the hound is not adjacent to your archer friend,
so the hound does nothing.
2.Agility comes next. Your ally chose agility, which beats the might stance of the orc. Your ally, seeing
she’s got the upper hand, decides to user her Execute ability, meaning her attack will deal a lot more
damage. She makes an attack roll against the orc, and the orc makes a defense roll. The orc decides it’s
more damage than he’s interested in, and decides to reduce his heart die to halve the damage. He remains
alive.
3.After agility comes might. You and the orc both chose might. Since you chose might, you can attack
either the orc (since you tied stances), or the hound (might beats cunning). You decide to attack the orc
since the orc is a greater threat and you want him dead. However, the orc decided to attack you as well,
since you were its only target. You each make contested attack rolls, with the loser taking the difference in
damage. Unfortunately you roll a bit lower, so you end up taking a few points of damage.
The engagement ends, since everyone who can attack has done so. The enemies now have priority. At
this point, nobody except for the orc has an action left, since the orc didn’t have to use an action to join the
engagement (they were forced to join). The orc might enter an engagement again with you, in which case
nobody else would have actions left to join, or they might not. The round continues.
```

Priority After the Engagement

Priority passes to side that was targeted when the
engagement first started, and continues as usual.

Ta k i n g D a m ag e

When you take damage, you can choose to use
some of your stamina to “shrug off” or "dodge" the
injury. In this case, you take half as much damage,
but your heart die falls one size. If you cannot
decrease your heart die because it's already a d4, you
must take the full amount of damage.
Regardless, whatever damage you do take gets
subtracted from your hit points. If this would cause
your hit points to reach a negative amount equal to
your maximum hit points, you are dead.

More Than 10 Damage

If you take 10 or more damage, this represents
serious bodily harm. In addition to reducing your hit
points, mark a wound. The GM will give you a plain
English description of the wound. For example, a
wound could be “a nasty gash in your arm,” or “a
fractured leg,” or “your guts are spilling out”. Write
this down. Next to it, write the rank of the wound.
The rank is equal to the amount of damage you took.
Read more about wounds in the next section.

Wou n ds

Wounds reduce your maximum hit points.
Whenever you gain hit points, you cannot increase
your hit points beyond your normal maximum minus
the sum of the ranks of all your wounds. So if you
normally have a 40 hit point maximum, but you have
23 ranks worth of wounds, you can't heal past 17 hit
points.
Outside of combat, wounds are like aspects,
which you can read about in the Aspects section

```
(page 10). Since they have a description and a rank,
you or the GM can invoke them for a penalty on a
roll equal to the rank of the wound, in exchange for
DP equal to the rank of the wound, up to 5.
```

```
Tr e a t i n g W ou n ds
Whenever you take a wound, you'll want to get it
treated. Treating a wound will mitigate a large
amount of the harm. To treat a wound, make a
medicine skill check and reduce the rank of all
untreated wounds affecting the wounded creature by
the rolled amount. If this would reduce a wound's
rank below zero, remove the wound completely.
If you are treating your own wounds, you have
disadvantage.
You can treat any number of wounds at once, but
once a wound has been treated it cannot be treated
again. Once treated, these wounds will naturally heal
over time when you take long rests. See the Rests &
Healing section for more details.

Zero Hit Points
When your hit points reach zero, you are in bad
condition. If you wish, you may choose to go
