Besides knowing the rules, there are some ways
to be a good Heart Rush player. This includes advice
for how to play this game compared to other RPGs.

Building a Char acter

When you create your character, it can be helpful
to think about certain questions. Doing so will help
you have a better grasp who you are playing, and
will enable you to have more fun playing as that
character. It’s a good idea to have some answers to
the following questions, but you can also feel free to
skip this step.

What Will You Be Known for?

This one is perhaps the most important. As
important as knowing who you are now, it is also
important to know who you will become. What do

```
you want to do with your life? How will you be
remembered?
```

```
What Do You Care About?
You need to know what matters to your character.
Do you have strong beliefs about something? What
are those beliefs? With strong beliefs, you are more
likely to have reasons to interact with the story, so it
is good to have some.
```

```
What Were You Doing Before?
You don’t need a full life story, but it’s a good
idea to have some idea of what you were doing
before the story begins. What were you doing
yesterday? How about last week? Last month? Last
year? Five years ago? The answers don’t need to be
precise, but with more details, the GM has more
material to work with for creating an immersive
story.
