# # Advanced Character Creation

WARNING: This section is still work in
progress.
For added depth to character creation and
progression, there are several other steps to character
creation. Everyone in the group should decide
together if they would like to use these optional
rules.

Skills

Skills represent talent in a specific area. When
you create a character, you start with no skills.
However, as you spend downtime practicing new
things and overcoming difficult tasks, you begin to
learn, slowly and automatically increasing your rank
in the relevant skills.
Like aspects, specializations are just a title and a
rank that grants bonuses to related skill checks.
When you create your character, you start with
no skills.
Gaining ranks in a skill happens via training and
overcoming challenges during gameplay. To gain a
rank in any skill, consult the following table.

```
The columns after the column for rank represent
the requirements for gaining that rank in a skill.
```

```
Downtime Weeks
In order to get the rank in a skill, you must spend
at least that many weeks of downtime devoted to
studying, training, and practicing that skill.
Additional weeks do not count towards future ranks.
```

```
Challenges
In addition to downtime spent practicing, you
need to succeed at a certain number of challenges to
achieve the next rank. A challenge is anything that
meets the following criteria:
```

- It must be a skill check using your
  specialization.
- The CN for the roll is at least the maximum of
  your heart die + your rank in the skill.
- There are narrative stakes to failing the roll.
  If all criteria are met, and the skill check is
  successful, you may mark down a challenge
  completed. Here are some examples of some skills
  and some corresponding challenges.
- Pickpocketing: Pickpocket a very wealthy
  merchant whoâ€™s actively looking for pickpockets.
- Hunting: Shoot a rampaging bull in the streets
  before the it hurts someone.
- Chariot Racing: Beat a fellow chariot driver in
  a race.
