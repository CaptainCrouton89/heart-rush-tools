Syncopath
By weakening the connection between your mind
and body, you can open yourself to the psionic winds
that drift across the world. The psionic winds carry
on them the thoughts and emotions of all sentient
creatures, and can be listened to. However,
weakening the link between mind and body comes
with risks—as your mind flows freely with the ideas
and feelings of others, your thoughts can be heavily
influenced by those around you, and your sense of
self becomes vulnerable. There is no “on or off”
switch—as the boundary between mind and self
weakens, there is no going back.
```

Tie r 1
```

  extending through walls and across physical
  boundaries.
- You gain the ability to roughly sense the
  emotional state of the sentient creatures within
  range. The GM will tell you the emotions being
  felt of creatures within range, but not which
  emotions belongs to which creatures.

  within range, you immediately know what they are
  thinking about you, as well as what their overall
  opinion of you is.
- If half or more of the conscious creatures in
  range dislike, distrust, or are in some other way
  associate negative emotions with you, you gain the

Tie r 2

- The range of your mental powers increases to
  45 feet.
- Whenever an ability allows you to sense the
  thoughts or emotional state of creatures around
  you, you can determine the direction from which
  those thoughts and emotions came from. When
  continually monitoring thoughts and emotions, you
  can only monitor one source at a time.
- You may choose something you can see, a
  sound you hear, or some other experience you’ve
  had in the last 5 seconds. You can hear the
  thoughts and emotions of all creatures in range that
  are about the subject you chose.
- When you are disliked, your rank in the “Self
  loathing” aspect is 2.

  range have untreated wounds or are in severe pain,

and mental capacity.
```

```
