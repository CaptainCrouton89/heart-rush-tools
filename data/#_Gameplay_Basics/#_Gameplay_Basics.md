# # Gameplay Basics

This section describes how general gameplay
should proceed.

Rolling Dice

Skill Checks

Whenever you attempt to do something that has a
realistic chance of failure, the GM may ask you to
roll a skill check to see if you succeed. Whenever
you roll a skill check, there are two dice you need to
roll—your heart die, and one of your ability dice.
The ability die should correspond to the activity you
are doing. For example, if you are lifting something
heavy, you should use your might die.
After rolling the dice, calculate the sum, and then
add any modifiers you may gain from your aspects
or other bonuses. If the sum of the dice is equal to or
higher than the GM’s predetermined challenge
number (CN), then you succeed.

Difficulties

The GM should use the following chart to set the
challenge number.

Complications
As your heart leads you through your life and
story, there may be times that it stutters. When it
does, you may fail at whatever you are doing, or
something else may go wrong. This is represented by
rolling a 1 on a skill check.
Whenever you make a skill check, if the result
on one of the dice is a 1, you must choose to either
automatically fail the check, or else you may re-roll
that die, using the new result. If you choose the
latter, a complication occurs. A complication does
not mean you fail to do what you were trying to do—
