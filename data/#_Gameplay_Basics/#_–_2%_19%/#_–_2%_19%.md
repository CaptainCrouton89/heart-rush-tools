```

```
The percentages in the cells correspond to the chance of success for a
typical human at full heart with low (d8+d6), high (d8+d8+2), and
very high(d8+d10+4) skill level. Note that players can eventually reach
up to d12+d20+10, and that this chart does not account for
complications.
```

```
Example
You are trying to climb around the edge of the
king’s tower without falling to your death. You
have to make a skill check and roll a 1 and a 5.
You really don’t want to fall, so you accept a
complication and re-roll the 1, getting a 4 instead.
The 9 is apparently high enough and you succeed
at climbing around the tower, but the GM
announces that in a near fall, you accidentally
knock a stone down, alerting the guards below.
```

use the total result after re-rolling your dice to
determine that. Instead, something related to the task
at hand but not determinate of your success or failure
goes wrong. This can be many things, such as
breaking your lock picks if you were trying to open a
door, or sparking a new line of interrogation if you
were trying to smooth talk your way past guards.
If you roll additional 1s they do not cause
complications.
If you roll two 1s as your first roll, you fail the
check, and there is a complication.

Raising the Stakes

Whenever you or another player makes a skill
check, but before the dice are rolled, you may choose
to raise the stakes. When you raise the stakes, you
increase the effectiveness of a success, and the
increase how disastrous the complication or failure is
on a fail. You may do this once once per session, on
any roll that any player makes.

Saving Throws

Whenever you have to roll to avoid or mitigate
the effects of someone else’s action, such as dodging
a falling boulder, or withstanding a powerful venom,
make a saving throw. Saving throws are identical to
skill checks, except they do not provoke
complications. Instead, rolling equal to or over the
challenge number implies you avoid the negative
effect, and rolling under implies suffering the
negative effect.
When the effect was created by another creature,
they are usually made against that creature’s ability
challenge number. If it was an effect from the
environment, the CN will be determined by the GM.

Ability Challenge Number

When another creature is avoiding an effect that
you have caused, the GM may have them roll a

```
saving throw. The CN for this roll is equal to the
maximum of your most applicable ability die, plus
two times your paragon level (which starts at zero).
This number is generically called your ability
challenge number, though more specifically, you
would have might, agility, cunning, presence, and
even heart challenge numbers. Use whichever ability
is most relevant for the roll, or if no ability die fits—
such as the case with magical effects—use your heart
challenge number—the maximum of your heart die
instead.
```

```
At tack & Defense Rolls
Attack and defense rolls, or A/D rolls, are made
whenever your roll to deal or negate damage in an
engagement or opportunity attack. Roll the relevant
ability die, your heart die, and add any necessary
modifiers. A/D rolls are explained in greater detail in
the Combat chapter.
```

```
Advantage & Disadvantage
Advantage and disadvantage give you bonuses or
penalties to a roll. For each instance of advantage
you have on a roll, roll an additional instance of the
lowest of the dice, and then remove the lowest result
when calculating the total. When rolling with
disadvantage, instead roll an additional instance of
the highest of the dice, and then remove the highest
result from the dice you rolled. Advantage and
disadvantage cancel out, and multiple instances of
either one can stack.
Multiple levels of advantage or disadvantage are
referred to as Ax or Dx, where 'x' indicates the
number of instances. When determining the outcome
with advantage or disadvantage, treat the final result
as if only the dice that were kept were rolled. For
instance, if you have an ability that activates when a
specific number is rolled, disregard the results from
