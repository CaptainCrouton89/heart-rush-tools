## # GAMEPLAY BASICS

the extra dice gained through advantage or
disadvantage, and consider only the results of the
retained dice.

Helping

When someone wishes to assist another person
with a skill check, they can choose to help. If you are
in combat, this requires your action. Helping grants
the person making the check advantage, so long as
you reasonably could provide help in that situation.
If you help someone, you are both liable to suffer
any consequences from any complications or
failures.

Group Rolls

Sometimes, everyone in a group will need to
make the same check, or will want to help on the
same check. For example, working together to break
down a door, sneaking past some guards, or
persuading a judge could all be group rolls. Rolls are
calculated differently, depending on the exact type of
task.
If everyone is making a check where the group is
only as strong as the weakest link, such as sneaking
past guards as a group, only one person rolls. Find
the person in the group who is the worst at making
this roll, and they make the roll for the group with
advantage. It is assumed that everyone else will

```
succeed, but if this person fails, everyone else may
fail as well.
However, if it is a task where people work
together, such as when everyone works together to
convince someone of the truth, then only the person
best at the task has to roll, and they may roll with
advantage.
```

Using Abilities

```
When creating your character, you will inevitably
gain a lot of abilities. Abilities are any chunk of rules
that let you create an affect, perform some activity,
or do anything at all. Examples include class
abilities, racial abilities, talents, and paragon levels,
though some abilities grant you their own abilities.
You can most easily recognize an ability because
of the format it has in this book:
```

```
Ability Name
Ability tags.
Rules text describing what the ability lets you do.
```

```
All abilities listed in this rulebook have their
name, followed by tags, and then followed by their
rules. For the most part, abilities can be used
whenever you want. However, some have
restrictions, usually listed in their tags, or if it's very
specific, in the ability rules itself.
All tags in an ability are separated by periods.
Each tag will contain information about when you
can use the ability, or what prerequisites there are for
gaining that ability. While many tags will be
explained by whichever section they appear in, there
are a few types which can show up on any type of
ability. These are listed below.
```

```
Example
You are trying to lift a heavy portcullis. Due
to various elements at play, you have three
sources of advantage, and one source of
disadvantage. Your might die is a d6, and your
heart die is a d8. When you make the roll, you
would roll with 2 levels of advantage—1d8 and
3d6. Lets say you get an 3, 6, 5, and 1,
respectively. The final result would be 11 (6 + 5).
```

Frequency Tags

The frequency of an ability determines how often
it can be used. An ability can be either, _passive_ ,
_minor_ , _heart_ , _major_ , _weekly_ , or _monthly_. This tag is
always listed as the first tag.

Pas s i v e A b i l i t y

There are no restrictions on how many times you
can use this ability. If the ability is a passive ability,
it is assumed to always be active.

Minor Ability

You may use this ability by spending a rush point
for each time you have used this ability including
this one during the current encounter. You may not
use it outside of an encounter.

Heart Abilit y

You may use this ability once per long rest. If
you take a wound, you may use the ability again.

Major Ability

```
You may use this ability once per long rest.
```

Weekly Abilit y

```
You may use this ability once per week.
```

Monthly Ability

```
You may use this ability once per month.
```

Ti m ing Tag

Outside of combat, you can use an ability
whenever you want—there are no restrictions
besides the ones listed on the ability itself. However,
during combat, you must have priority to use your
abilities. Priority is described in detail in the Combat
section. However, the _instant_ tag is an exception to

```
that rule. Abilities that don’t have the instant tag are
referred to as “priority abilities”.
```

```
Instant
If an ability is marked as instant, it means that
the ability can be used literally any time, even when
you don't have priority. While another creature is
using an ability, while you roll dice for an attack—
literally any time, so long as the ability doesn’t have
any further explicit instructions on when it can be
used.
If multiple creatures want to use an instant
ability, whoever declared their use last goes first.
You must declare the way in which you are using
your ability when you announce that you are using
an ability.
```

```
action Tag
During each round of combat, you only have one
action. By default, abilities don’t use your action
unless they have the full action tag.
If an ability is marked as full action , it means that
the ability uses your action. If you don't have an
action left during this round, you cannot use the
ability.
```

Other Rules

```
Forced Movement
If you are ever pushed or forced to move, and
this movement is interrupted by a wall, another
creature that is within two sizes of your own, or a
heavy shield being wielded by an enemy, you
immediately stop moving and take 1d6 damage for
every 5 feet remaining in your movement. If this
movement is stopped by a creature that is not
wielding a shield, the movement is still stopped, and
```
