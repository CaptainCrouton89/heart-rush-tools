## # GAMEPLAY BASICS

Poisons

While exploring Alaria, you may come across
various poisons. Different poisons have different
properties and means of application. Some may
paralyze you, but only if ingested, while other may
kill you if they enter directly into your bloodstream,
but are otherwise harmless if swallowed. Some are
long lasting, some are instant, some can be applied to
weapons and maintain potency for minutes to days,
while others can’t be applied to weapons at all.
While most poisons will have specific rulings
applied to them individually, some general poisoning
rules apply to most of them.
Due to the difficulty of properly applying poison,
poison cannot be applied to a weapon during combat.
Each application of the poison uses up one dose of
that poison, and dealing damage with a weapon with
poison applied to it uses up the poison. Most poisons
can be applied to weapons prior to combat. The
length that the poison remains potent on the weapon
will vary from poison to poison, after which the
poison must be scraped off and a new coat applied in
order to still garner the same effects. Damage from
poison happens after the weapon attack—it is not
rolled with the attack dice.

Experience

```
Over the course of many games, you will gain
more and more XP. With this XP, you can purchase
new, interesting features for your character.
```

```
Gaining Experience
It is up to the GM to deliver XP to players. They
can decide what they want to award XP for,
depending on the type of game they want to run.
Common triggers for rewarding XP are pursuing
goals, reaching milestones in a story arc, winning
combats, or just length of session. Whatever the
metric for determining XP, the GM should
communicate this to the players.
```

```
Spending Experience
Between sessions, or during sessions so long as
you are not in combat, you may spend XP to access
new features. Use the following chart to find the cost
of your desired new feature.

Le v e l i n g
New Aspect 1 Add a new aspect at rank 1.
Increase Aspect X+1, Where X is the aspect’s
current level
```

```
Increase the rank of an aspect by 1.
```

```
Change Aspect 0 Replace the text of your aspect with different text.
```

```
GM Note
Granting XP equal to players’ combat rank is
a decent rule of thumb to keep players upgrading
their character every few sessions. If you want
slightly more aggressive growth, increasing this
by one, or even two can be okay.
```

New Aspect

Creating a new aspect means writing down
another word or phrase describing your character.
The aspect starts at rank one.

Increase Aspect

Increase the rank of one your aspects by one.
Aspects cannot have a rank greater than five.

Change Aspect

You may replace your aspect with a brand new
aspect, if you believe your character development
warrants it. The aspect remains at the same rank, but
you may change the description.

Increase Maximum Hit Points

```
Increase your maximum hit points by 10.
```

Increase Ability Die

Increase an ability die by one size. Ability die
size increases in the order d4 > d6 > d8 > d10 > d12

> d20. Each increase costs XP equal to the size of the
> new die, so an increase from d8 to d10 would cost

10. You cannot increase your heart die in this way.

```
