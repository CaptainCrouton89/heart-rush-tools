## # GAMEPLAY BASICS

the total damage is split evenly between the two
creatures, rounded up for the creature being forced to
move.

Size

Creatures can be of many different sizes. From
smallest to largest, they are: minuscule, tiny, small,
medium, large, and then L2, L3, L4, and so on.
Different sizes come with different bonuses and
penalties, especially in combat.
Up to a thousand minuscule creatures can fit into
a single space, ten tiny creatures can fit on one
space; five small creatures can fit on one space; one
medium or large creature on one space; and creatures
of sizes L2 and greater take up a number of spaces
equal to the square of their level. For example, an L
creature would take up four spaces (2x2 spaces), and
an L5 creature would take up twenty-five spaces
(5x5 spaces).

At tacking

Whenever an attacking creature uses the might
stance to push a defending creature of a different
size, the defending creature may move more or less
than the default of 10 feet. If the defending creature
is smaller than the attacker, the defending creature
moves an additional 5 feet for each level of size
difference. If the defending creature is larger than the
attacker, the defending creature moves 5 fewer feet
for each level of size difference. This could mean
that the defending creature is not pushed at all.

Movement and Spaces

One creature can occupy and move through the
space of another creature if it is at least two sizes
smaller. Those creatures count as difficult terrain.
While in the same space as a non-hostile creature,
you also have one level of cover.

```
Weapons
Creatures of size small or tiny cannot wield
heavy weapons. Creatures of size tiny cannot wield
heavy or light weapons.
```

```
Li g h t i n g
There are three different states of lighting that
can occur in an environment: brightly lit, dim, and
dark.
Daylight, the immediate area around a lantern,
and intense fire all produce bright light. There are no
penalties to vision or combat while in a brightly lit
area.
Dim light can be found in alleyways, twilight,
and in all the spaces between bright light and
darkness. Perception and observation skill checks are
made with disadvantage for creatures that require
light to see.
Darkness is anywhere there is no light. Unless
you have darkvision, you cannot see anything.
```

```
Darkvision
Some creatures have darkvision. A creature with
darkvision can see in dim light as though it were
bright light, and can see in darkness as though it
were dim light.
```

```
Hiding
If the environment provides suitable places to
hide and the GM deems it reasonable, you may
choose to hide. This requires more than a single
action, and cannot be performed during combat.
When you attempt to hide, make a stealth skill
check. On a success you are hidden, and count as
unseen for the purposes of attacking.
While hidden, you may use your action to make
an opportunity attack against a creature you are
hidden from. You may still be obscured after you
```

attack, but you do not count as hidden and you
cannot make opportunity attacks.
All hidden creatures that wish to make
opportunity attacks may use their action to attack
before combat begins.

Te r r ain

As you adventure, you will encounter numerous
environments that all pose their own unique
challenges.

Difficult Terrain

Difficult terrain is any terrain that is inherently
hard to move through, such as water, mud, or heavy
foliage. While in difficult terrain, after accounting
for other movement penalties, your remaining
movement speed is halved.

Wat e r

Doing anything while in or under water comes
with severe limitations. While shallow water counts
only as difficult terrain, deeper water requires that
you move at your swim speed. Unless you explicitly
have a swim speed, your base swim speed is 15 feet.
If you can still stand, you have disadvantage on all
A/D rolls and skill checks requiring movement. If
you cannot stand, or if you are underwater, you have
D5 on all of those rolls instead. Ranged weapons
travel half their distance when fired underwater.

Vertical Surfaces

When climbing, you may be required to make a
might check to determine if you can climb at all. On
a success, you can climb at your climb speed, which
unless otherwise explicitly stated, is 5 feet.

```
Sources of Dam age
There are several other sources of damage
besides combat. Some of the more common ones are
listed below.
```

```
Combat
Combat is one of the most common ways to lose
health. Check out the Combat section to learn more.
```

```
Hazards & Traps
There will be times when you have to avoid
damage from the environment. For example, being
hit by a falling rock, struck with a dart trap, or
getting knocked over by the jibing boom of a ship. In
these cases, you should make a saving throw,
detailed in the Saving Throws section. On a failure,
you will take damage.
```

```
Falling
When falling from 5 feet or more, roll an agility
saving throw against the height fallen. If you roll less
than the distance fallen, you take the difference as
damage.
```

```
Suffocation and Strangulation
There are different effects on oneâ€™s body
depending if you are holding your breath, or getting
strangled or suffocated by something else.
When holding your breath, make a might check.
You can hold your breath a number of rounds equal
to your result. Subtract one from the total number of
rounds whenever you take an action or move while
holding your breath. After you run out of breath, you
take the suffocating condition.
If you are strangled, unable to breathe, or were
suddenly prevented from breathing, then you begin
suffocating immediately.
```
