# # Armies

When large numbers of combatants collide, it
may become more useful to use the rules for armies,
rather than individuals. These rules are intended to
make large battles play out in a way that feels
cinematic and more narratively satisfying than
simply rolling a single die and declaring a victor.
They allow one or more players to control troops in a
battle against one or more other enemy forces.

Units

Every army is composed of units—similarly
sized groups of combatants who fight as a group.
Because different battles happen at different scales, a
unit consists of however many soldiers can fit on a
single square of a battle map. If the battle map scale
is 1:25, this may mean that a single mountain giant
counts as a unit, while 25 human soldiers also count
as a single unit. If the scale is instead 1:100, then one
unit could consist of four mountain giants, or 400
soldiers. Before any big battle, it is important to

```
determine the scale so that you can allocate your
soldiers into units. Scales that result in 5–15 units are
usually best.
```

```
Allocating Units
Once you have determined the scale of the battle,
it is time to allocate your soldiers into units. For
example, if the scale of our battle was 1:25, if you
had 300 infantrymen, 100 cavalry, and 50 archers,
then you would have 12 infantry units, 4 cavalry
units, and 2 archer units.
After determining which units are included in
your army, you can assign their stats. Details on how
these stats are used will be described later, but for
now, just focus on the troop name in the table below,
and whether it accurately describes your unit. If you
have a unit that is not included in the table, find its
closest approximation, or else come up with your
own stats. It is ultimately up to the GM to approve
the stats of your unit, but they will be using the same
guidance as you.

Officer Units

When there are troops, there must also be
officers—those in control of managing those troops
on the battlefield. For every four units in an army,
select one of them to contain an officer. If a troop is
ever more than four spaces from an officer, then the
unit loses discipline and is disbanded. This means
that the troop either flees, surrenders, or gives up at
fighting, and should be removed from the board.
If the unit containing the officer is ever
disbanded, or if the officer is killed, isolated, or
otherwise prevented from communicated, then the
unit no longer counts as containing an officer,
potentially causing nearby troops to be disbanded as
well.

```
Commanders
At the head of every army is its commander—the
person in charge of the operations and tactics of their
troops, and in charge of all of the officers. This could
be a trustworthy NPC, or even a player. In either
case, they must be chosen before a battle begins, and
a new commander cannot be selected until the battle
is over. As with officers, they reside in a unit.
Choose one of your units to contain the commander.
Just like with officers, if an officer unit is ever more
than eight spaces from the commander, then the
officer unit is disbanded.
If the commander dies during a battle, is isolated
from their army, or is otherwise no longer capable of
giving commands to their troops, they lose. It doesn’t
matter if all of their troops are still healthy—all order
and discipline is lost, the battle is over, and the

enemy achieves whatever they were trying to

Battlefield

Before playing out a battle, it is also important to
lay out the battlefield. If there are walls or
barricades, draw them out as lines between spaces. If
there is a river, fill in squares as impassable or
difficult. All of these things should be drawn out on a
battle map, at a scale equal to the unit size of the
troops in the battle.
After drawing the map, determine which army is
defending. In nearly every battle, there are the
people who are occupying a location, and there are
the people who want to take that location from
them^1. The first are the defenders, and the latter are
the attackers.
First, the commander of the attacking army must
determine in which direction they are attacking from.
This should be announced to the defending army, as
unless otherwise stated, they would be able to see
their attackers
Once the attacker has declared a direction of
attack, if you are the defending army, you get to lay
out your units, wherever and however you wish.
Make sure to keep all troops within range of an
officer, and all officers within range of your
commander.
After the defending army has done this, the
attacking army may place their troops. Unless
explicitly allowed, each unit must be placed at least
6 spaces away from the closest enemy troop, or
further, and must be in a position that the GM deems
reasonable, given their direction of approach. If the
defender would have been able to see the attacker’s
approach from further away, they may choose to

```
force the attackers to place their troops at a more
distant range instead.
```

Battle

```
A battle takes course over rounds—each
containing a turn for the attackers, and then the
defenders.
On the attackers turn, each unit can be moved in
a straight line up a number of spaces equal to that
unit’s movement speed. The line must not intersect
with any other unit on the map—even diagonally,
and it must end in an open space. When determining
diagonal distances, count the first diagonal as one
space, the next diagonal as two spaces, and then one
again, and so on.
After each unit has been moved, that player may
make attacks for each of their units. To make an
attack with a unit, that unit must have an enemy unit
within range. For melee units, that means it must be
adjacent (this includes diagonals).
When making the attack, the attacking and
defending units should each roll their power die. If
the defender rolled lower than the attacker, the
defender loses morale equal to the difference. If this
would result in the defender have zero or less
morale, then the unit is disbanded, and removed
from battle.
```

```
Special Units
At the most basic level, that is all there is to
combat. However, there are a few, common types of
special units that have unique rules.
```

(^1) If you are certain that both sides are attackers (such as the unlikely scenario in which both sides are meeting in open ground with the sole purpose of
killing each other), then have the commander of each participating army making an operations (cunning) check. The loser must place their troops
first. If there are more than two armies clashing, proceed in order from lowest to highest.

Ranged Units

Ranged units usually have a range greater than
one, allowing them to attack units more than one
space away. All units have disadvantage when
making defense rolls against ranged units. When
ranged units make defense rolls, they automatically
roll 1s.

Aerial Units

Aerial units are units that can fly. When they
move, they can move through other units, and they
can end their movement on top of another unit. In
addition, they can only be attacked by ranged units
and other aerial units.

Siege Units

Siege units are really just spaces that have
equipment on them (such as siege engines, or
mounted ballista). Rather than attacking, a unit may
choose to man a siege unit. While doing so, that unit
takes on all of the stats of the siege unit except for
morale, which is inherited from the unit that is
manning the siege unit.
When siege units make defense rolls, they
automatically roll 1s.

Fortifications & Terrain

Besides units, there may also be fortifications
and terrain effects on the battlefield. A space can be
marked as a fortification. If so, it will have some
number of hit points. So long as it has hit points
remaining, all troops within the space gain a flat
bonus to their defense rolls determined by the stats
of that fortification. Additionally, melee attacks
cannot be made from a fortified area to a non-
fortified area, and vice-versa.
Fortifications can only be damaged by siege
weapons. When a siege unit attacks, it can choose to

```
target a fortification, in which case all of its damage
goes directly to the fortification.
```

```
Players on the Battlefield
Can be officers, can be commanders, can be elite
fighting force.
```

```
During combat, a unit can move a number of
squares equal to its movement speed. It can only
move in a straight line, and that line cannot pass
through any other units. It can then attack any unit.
Whenever you attack with a unit, roll that unit’s
power die. The defending unit also rolls their power
die. The defender takes damage equal to the
difference.
Infantry and other non-cavalry grounded, melee
units have disadvantage on defense rolls against non-
adjacent (ranged) attackers.
Ranged defenders automatically roll the
minimum on any defense roll.
Cannot move through another troop, and your
own troops count as difficult terrain.
People with better commander take their turn
first.
Aerial units can only be attacked by ranged
attackers and other aerial attackers. They can be on
the same square as another unit.
```

```
Tac t i cs
Passive ability. You are commander.
Can force a unit to come forward one space if
you retreat (taunting it, luring it in. This could cause
it to leave the range of commander/officers).
```

```
Commander
```

Must move first, then attack. No movement after.
Can move extra space if you don’t attack.

```
Misc terrain effects:
```

- High ground: advantage on attack and defense
  rolls. Ranged attackers have +1 range.
- Difficult terrain: move reduced by half,
  rounded down, minimum of one.
- Fog: Can’t see anything beyond immediately
  adjacent tile.

```
Player interaction:
```

- Can join a troop to give a bonus to it
- Can play as commander
- Or do missions
  - Scout: Figure out where troops are

```
If you kill enemy commander, they lose.
