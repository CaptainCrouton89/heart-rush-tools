# # Weapons, Cantrips & Armor

Equipment encompasses all of the gear you
might use while adventuring. When you first create
your character, you will likely start out with a
weapon and some armor, though it is up to the GM.
Also in this section are the rules for cantrips.
Cantrips are very similar to weapons; you choose
stances, and on a hit you usually get to make an
attack roll with your chosen stance. Cantrips differ
from weapons in that there is no physical weapon
used to strike the opponent, and only those with
magical attunements can use them.

Weapons

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and
damage type, which together describe the weapon
and its properties. You may choose one weapon to be
your primary weapon. This weapon does not use up
equipment slots.
You can only wield one weapon at a time. If
wielding a weapon does not require being held in
your hands, it does not count towards this restriction.

Size

The size of weapon refers to how big and
powerful the weapon is. Three sizes exist: heavy,
light, and ultralight or improvised. It is up to the GM
to determine the size of any given weapon.

Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons require two hands, can only be
wielded by creatures of size medium or larger, and
cannot be easily hidden upon your body. Longbows,

```
long swords, pikes, mauls, and heavy crossbows are
examples of heavy weapons. Whenever you use a
heavy weapon, add 1d12 to your attack rolls. Your
move speed decreases by 5 feet if this weapon is not
part of your body. Heavy weapons use 10 gear slots
unless they are your primary weapon or part of your
body.
```

```
Li g h t W e a p o n s
Light weapons are, as their name suggests, light,
and are easy to handle. Crossbows, shortswords, and
shortbows are all examples of light weapons.
Whenever you use a light weapon, add 1d8 to your
attack rolls. Light weapons use 5 gear slots unless
they are your primary weapon or part of your body.
```

```
Ultralight Weapons
Ultralight weapons are small and easy to handle.
Knives, shurikens, and claws count as ultralight
weapons. Whenever you use an ultralight weapon,
add 1d4 to your attack roll. Ultralight weapons use 2
gear slots unless they are your primary weapon or
are part of your body.
```

```
Improvised Weapons
Chairs, your teeth, and your falling body can all
be weapons in the right context. Improvised weapons
count as ultralight weapons unless indicated
otherwise.
```

```
At tack Ty pe
Two types of weapons exist: melee and ranged.
Each come with different benefits.
```

Melee

Melee weapons are weapons that do not involve
any part of the weapon leaving your hand. They are
generally more powerful than ranged weapons, due
to the fact that they have a lot of weight attached to
them. Heavy melee weapons require two hands, and
light and ultralight melee weapons require only one.
Melee weapons have a range of 5 feet.
* *Might Stance Bonus** : You may push the
defending creature 10 feet away from you after
everyone in the engagement has made their might
attack roll. You may enter any of the free spaces they
left or passed through because of your attack.
Moving into that space does not provoke opportunity
attacks.

Ranged

Ranged weapons trade damage for being able to
inflict injuries from a safer distance. Light ranged
weapons have a range of 30 ft, and heavy ranged
weapons have a range of 60 ft. You can attack targets
outside of that range, but have disadvantage to the
attack for every 10 feet beyond the range listed, to a
maximum of double the weapon’s range.
Ranged weapons come with drawbacks,
however. All ranged weapons require two hands
unless specifically noted otherwise, and you cannot
choose anything but the defensive stance if you
move more than half of your move speed (after
accounting for armor and other penalties) during a
round, and cannot move more than half your move
speed (after accounting for armor and other
penalties) if you already took a non-defensive stance
in an engagement.
* *Might Stance Bonus** : Creatures defending
against this attack cannot add their defense bonus
from armor to their defense roll.

```
Th row n
Thrown weapons are a special category of
weapons that combine elements of both melee and
ranged combat. They behave similarly to melee
weapons in terms of handling but are used up as they
are thrown. Thrown weapons have a range of 20 feet.
You can attack targets outside of that range, but have
disadvantage on the attack for every 5 feet beyond
the range listed, to a maximum of double the
weapon’s range.
Unless otherwise stated, only ultralight weapons
can be thrown. Weapons cannot be thrown in water.
Might Stance Bonus : The first time you hit with
a thrown weapon attack in an engagement, you may
make an immediate follow-up attack with another
thrown weapon against a different valid target in the
engagement.
```

```
Whip
Whips have a range of 20 feet. Unless otherwise
stated, only ultralight weapons can be whips.
Whips cannot be used in water.
Might Stance Bonus : Add another weapon die
to your attack roll.
```

Damage Type

```
Bludgeoning
Bludgeoning weapons use raw force to inflict
damage, and therefore are best used with high might.
Examples of bludgeoning weapons include war
hammers and clubs. Whenever you wield a
bludgeoning weapon and use the might stance, add
an additional weapon die to your roll.
```

```
Slashing
Slashing weapons use accuracy and dexterity to
inflict damage, and therefore are best used with high
agility. Examples of slashing weapons include
```
