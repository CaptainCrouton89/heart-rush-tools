Armor works by increasing your defense rolls,
making it harder for damage to get through. Armor,
as with other clothing, does not require equipment
slots while being worn.

decreases by 10 feet. Medium armor uses 10 slots
unless it is being worn.

Add 2 to your defense rolls. Your move speed
decreases by 5 feet. Light armor uses 5 slots unless it
is being worn.

No Armor

There is no bonus or penalty for having no
armor.

Natural Armor

Some creatures have natural armor. Natural
armor can provide any amount of bonus to oneâ€™s
defense rolls, and applies no movement speed
penalty. You cannot choose to have natural armor.

Shields

Like armor, shields help you stay alive. You must
have a free hand available to wield a shield (e.g.
wielding a light melee weapon in the other hand).

Heavy Shields

Add 2 to your defense rolls. Your move speed
decreases by 5 feet.
Additionally, other allies may treat your space as
