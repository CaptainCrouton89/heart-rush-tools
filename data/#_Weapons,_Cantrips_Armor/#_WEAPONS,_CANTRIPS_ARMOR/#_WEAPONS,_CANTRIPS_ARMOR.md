## # WEAPONS, CANTRIPS & ARMOR

swords and scythes. Whenever you wield a slashing
weapon and use the agility stance, add an additional
weapon die to your roll.

Piercing

Piercing weapons use knowledge of your
opponents maneuvering to inflict damage, and
therefore are best used with high cunning. Examples
of piercing weapons include rapiers and weapons
that use arrows. Whenever you wield a piercing
weapon and use the cunning stance, add an
additional weapon die to your roll.

Other Weapon Tags

Every weapon has a size, attack type, and
damage type. However, weapons can also have tags,
making them further distinct.

Reach

Melee weapons can have this tag. If you haven’t
dashed this round, the range of this weapon is 10 feet
instead of 5. If you attack a creature at this extended
range, you cannot dash this round.

Cantrips

Cantrips are very similar to normal weapons.
They can be melee or ranged, and heavy, light, or
ultralight, and they can be cast any time you would
normally make an attack with a weapon. However,
unlike weapons, you can only use a cantrip if you
have an attunement to the corresponding element.
Also, since elemental attacks are not always
physical, they don't always deal damage, and the
bonus granted by the might stance is sometimes
different.
There are two types of cantrips—bolts, and
blasts. Bolts are arcs of energy that shoot in a line

```
from your hand, while blasts are short bursts of
energy emitted from the caster themselves. Each
have more specific rules outlined in their sections.
```

```
Bolts
Bolts are individual streaks of elemental energy
or matter that are fired from a single hand. They
behave similarly to ranged weapon attacks, though
they do not get a bonus from damage type. All bolt
cantrips have a range of 30 feet at basic attunement
to that element, 60 feet at advanced attunement, and
120 feet at paragon attunement.
```

Why Are Cantrips Near the Weapon
Section?
Conceptually, cantrips and weapons are
obviously different. However, the rules for
spells are similar to ranged weapons. Unlike
spells, they are used during engagements in the
same way as weapons. People with attunements
can use them like “utility” arrows, where each
type of bolt and blast has some convenient
effect, possibly in addition to damage.

```

```
Blasts
Blasts are outbursts of an element centered on
one’s self, generally taking the form of a rapidly
expanding circle of elemental matter or energy. They
behave similarly to melee weapon attacks, in that
you must choose a stance, can only attack those
whom your stance beats, and gain the benefits
associated with each stance—though not all blasts
deal damage, and not all blasts are attacks. You must
have both hands free to use blast cantrips.
After choosing a stance, blast cantrips affect up
to two valid targets of your stance within 5 feet of
you. At advanced attunement, the cantrip affects any
number of valid targets in range. At paragon
attunement, the range of your blast increases by 5
feet.
```
