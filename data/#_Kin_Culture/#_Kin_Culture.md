# # Kin & Culture

When you create a character, choose a race, and
if available, an associated heritage within that race.
Your race is your literal species of sentient creature,
while your heritage describes the collective identity,
history, and culture you belong to. Heritages come
and go with the millennia, and transform over time,
while a race will stay the same.
Many races have multiple heritages to choose
from. This stems from their relative profusion across
thew world. Races with fewer heritages, or only one
heritage are less prolific, and therefore lack the same
levels of variety.
When you choose your race and heritage, you
gain all of the aspects and abilities granted by your
choices. The aspects from your race and heritage are
suggestions for that group, but you are welcome to
choose different aspects, so long as you make sure
you have a clear idea of why _you_ are different from
the rest of your community.
The races and heritages are listed at the end of
this book because they are the easiest to be added to.
If you have an idea for a new race or heritage for
your group, don’t hesitate to reach out to the GM and
propose your idea. Each race and heritage
combination adds up to about 2.5-3 talents worth of
power.

GM Note
The races listed in this chapter are a small
selection of the races that exist in the author’s
own campaign setting. But you should create
your own—it’s easy! Every race is just two
aspects, and two abilities that are each about as
powerful as a talent.

Human

Humans are resilient and abundant. They are far
the most prolific across Alaria, and have the greatest
breadth of culture. Contributing to their success as a
species is their perseverance; just when you think
you’ve knocked one down for good, they’re back up
for more.

Vitals

- Size: Medium
- Height: 5-6.5 feet
- Weight: 100-180 pounds

Human Resilience and Diversity
_Passive ability._

When you gain this ability, choose one talent.
You gain this talent as a racial ability (it does not
count towards the number of talents you have).
In addition, whenever you take a wound, you
gain a rush point at the start of the next round.

Drachma

Drachma are fierce, passionate, and boisterous,
and place a high emphasis on valor, panache, and
following ones instincts. They are usually the first
one you notice when walking into a room—both for
their striking, long, shiny black hair that many of
them maintain, as well as their sociable personalities.
It is hard to feel unwelcome when around Drachma.
Drachma are generally found in western regions
of Alaria, along the coasts, and are known for their
pirates, merchants, and swindlers, as well as their
hearty Drachman ale.

Aspects

- Style is everything
- I follow my instincts

Instinctive
Passive ability.
When you get a complication on a skill check
and choose to re-roll, add 3 to the new result.

Tikh aya
Tikhaya are generous, quiet, and highly value
strength and truth. Some would mistake Tikhaya for
being socially inept, or boring, but the fact is that
Tikhaya are simply uninterested in idle chat, and are
comfortable spending time alone and in
contemplation. There is a sort of strength that
emanates from Tikhaya that has nothing to do with
their physiology—but instead from their self-
certainty and outlook on the ways of the world. Even
Tikhaya children have a sort of natural wisdom about
them that is hardly met by even adults of other
cultures.
Tikhaya can be found across central and northern
Alaria, as well as the Nautili Archipelago, and are
known for their incredible philosophers,
mathematicians, and martial warriors.

Clear Mind
Passive ability.
You are immune to being confused, frightened,
enraged, or charmed. Additionally, you have A2
when making skill checks or saving throws to see
through deception.
```

```
Neth
Neth are thoughtful and inscrutable, and place a
high emphasis on community, ancestry, and wind. It
is easy to misinterpret a Neth’s silence at a joke as
boredom or even worse, anger, but if you look
