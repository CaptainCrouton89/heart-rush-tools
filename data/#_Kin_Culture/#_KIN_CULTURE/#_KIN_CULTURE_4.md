## # KIN & CULTURE

Gnome

Gnomes are small, naturally magical creatures,
resembling miniature humans. They range in height
from two to three feet, and are frequently quite
slender and nimble. Gnomish adventurers are
generally more magically adept than hearty, and will
often have entire sleeves of handmagic tattoos
stretching up their arms.

Goshwen (Hill Gnome)

If there is one thing that can be said abut
Goshwen gnomes, it is that they are clever. Not
intelligent, nor wise—few are scholars, and they get
into trouble all the time—but they are definitely
clever. Inventors, tricksters, comedians, thieves,
merchants—these are the professions Goshwen are
known for. Goshwen are a good natured, frequently
witty people, who have lived on Alaria for eons.
While countries go to war, the Goswhen are content
to lace their cities with illusions and abstain from
battle. There are no Goshwen empires, nor Goshwen
wars, or invasions. Goshwen are elusive, and
competent.
Goshwen’s culture of openness and constant
change has resulted in numerous fragmentations of
their communities. This has given rise to many

```
different branches of Goshwen communities across
Alaria with different quirks and identities. However,
all of them maintain their appreciation for progress
and wit.

Ezuri (Tr e e G n om e)
The Ezuri, or “tree people” as it translates to
from Old Gnomish, stemmed from when Mad
Gorehorn disease ravaged what is now known as the
Jungles of Titania, transforming many of the forest
dwelling creatures into rabid, flesh eating monsters.
While many fled the jungle, some were trapped, and
forced up and into the trees. By the time the disease
had passed, the gnomes were comfortable in their
new living situation. Nowadays, the Ezuri live across
Alaria, usually living in interconnected houses built
among the trees, or if not, in other closely knit, lofty
places.
The Ezuri also value connection with each other
as well as the natural world around them, and are
taught the secrets of speaking with animals from a
young age. This, combined with their natural affinity
for magic, allow them to stand up to the much larger
humanoids across Alaria.
