## # KIN & CULTURE

Goblin

Goblins are born in broods, from a single father
and up to hundreds of mothers. A single brood-father
may sire thousands of goblin children, who are all
raised together, with no knowledge of their specific
mother. The brood-father, over the course of his
lifetime, will eventually choose exactly one queen,
who will mother the next brood-father—the first
born son.
Most goblins live in communities around a single
goblin lineage. Therefore, all of their neighbors and
friends are one’s half-siblings. This can lead to
bickering, but very rarely outright violent conflict.
Living among siblings contributes to a camaraderie
that many goblins feel towards their brood-mates.

Cooperative

_Passive ability._
Whenever you help someone on a skill check, or
take the help action in combat, you provide two
levels of advantage rather than one, and they may
add half of any single relevant aspect you have. You
do not need to spend DP. If that creature is a goblin,
they gain three levels of advantage instead.

Scal awag

Scalawag goblins are aptly named for their
mischievous, sneaky, and up-to-no-good nature.
They are viewed more as pests than as people by
many of the intelligent beings of Alaria, and from a
scientific perspective, their behaviors is somewhat
similar to that of ants. However; living among

```
Scalawag society shows a vivid, colorful culture of
merriment, passion, and duty. Most Scalawag are
born into enormous broods, and are expected to
defend their lineage of goblins. These goblins will
spend most of their lives doing just that, along with
anything else they feel like doing. Besides the
general wellbeing of the community, though,
scalawags have few other obligations, and will
sometimes devote horrifying amounts of time to the
most absurd activities for fun or curiosity.
Scalawag can be found across the mountains and
scattered throughout most cultural hubs, and are
known for their incredible performers, parties, and
oddly enough, philosophers.

Ankle Biter
Passive ability.
Rules for moving through and climbing on
creatures larger than yourself apply even if the
creature is only one size larger than you. You have
advantage on all checks made to climb onto and hold
onto those creatures. In addition, larger creatures do
not count as difficult terrain, and occupying the same
space as a hostile creatures provides one level of
cover from attacks from all other creatures.

Etherweaver
Etherweavers get their name for their longtime
mastery over the non-basic elements—light, dark,
force, time, and void. The entire etherweaver
bloodline is interwoven with these elements, and
every goblin is born with an attunement to one of
those elements.
Etherweavers are generally more reserved and
cautious than their Scalawag cousins. They value
