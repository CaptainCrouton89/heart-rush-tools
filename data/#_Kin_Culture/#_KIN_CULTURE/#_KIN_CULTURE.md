## # KIN & CULTURE

carefully, you may see a glint in their eyes, and they
will soon fire back a joke of their own, all while
never breaking a smile.
Neth are best known for their ability to speak
with the wind, allowing them to communicate with
the deceased members of their communities to gather
advice. The advice and secrets of their ancestors is
central to the longevity and power of the many Neth-
composed tribes that cover the northern tundras. For
this reason, maintaining good relation with one’s
family, and community are critical to Neth culture,
an outlook and behavior that extends to friends they
meet who become close.
Neth can be found across the North Reach, along
the coast, and in the north-eastern regions above
Atyeska, and are famous for their sages, soothsayers,
and resilient warriors.

Aspects

- Inscrutable
- If you look after nature, nature will look after
  you

Speak With the Wind
_Major ability._
While outdoors, when the north wind blows, you
can hear the voices of your ancestors. Once per day,
while not in combat, you may reach out to your
ancestors to ask for their guidance. Choose one:

- Questions and Answers: You may ask them up
  to three questions. They answer to the best of their
  ability. Although they only know what they knew
  during their lifetimes, their knowledge spans
  nearly a millennium.
- Guidance: Define a specific type of task or
  activity. Once, before the end of the day, before
  making a roll for that task or activity, you may
  declare that you are using your ancestors’
  guidance. After rolling, you may replace either die
  with the maximum result of that die.

Oznak
Oznak are proud, brave, and competitive, and
place a high emphasis on proving one’s self-worth
and accruing technical skill with a blade. From a
young age, children are taught with sticks how to
wield a sword, even if they will never be able to
afford a real sword in their lifetime. Most festivals in
Oznak-dominated settlements also include different
types of competitions involving sword play, and
proper tournaments are common in some regions.
While excelling with the blade garners the most
respect, those who don’t become the best are
pressured to succeed and dominate in another field.
This mentality results in a culture of highly
competitive people. Because they value skill so
highly, cheating or cutting corners to get to the top is
seen as despicable, and is a quick path to getting into
a duel with an Oznak.
Oznak can be found across Central North Alaria,
though individuals can be found nearly anywhere in
the world, and are known for their technical
craftsmen, powerful merchants, and terrifying
swordsmen.

Naga (Dragon Blooded)
Naga make up a long line of humans with dragon
blood running in their veins. Every Naga is a distant
```

descendent of Nagatayora, the almighty dragon-
father and first son of Gaea. When Shara Bolasi died
to Hykravones, Nagatayora flew into a rage and
threw himself at the powerful titan. Such was his
ferocity and intensity, Hykravones was nearly
defeated. But slowly at first, and then methodically,
Hykravones beat Nagatayora back, until finally
grabbing ahold of each end of the colossal dragon
and tearing him in two. As the fiery blood fell, and
heated the lands beneath it, the people below
transformed and became the Naga that still exist
today.
Naga are passionate and determined in all that
they set their minds to, and have an incredibly rich
culture of art, religious tradition, and philosophy.
They also have a profound sense of pride, both for
themselves, their culture, and the things they care
about. If they feel that any of those things have been
wronged, then they will not back down until amends
have been made. Their fury is a terrible force to
behold.

Aspects

- Iron determination
- Boiling vengeance

Aspect of the Dragon

_Major ability._
You may channel your blood of Naga, and
transform into a dragon-like form. Your head morphs
into the head of a dragon and your scales surface in
patches over your skin. While in this form, you gain
the following traits:

- You take half damage from fire.
- You gain +1 to defense rolls from your natural,
  scaly armor.
- You may belch fire, dealing 2d6 damage in a
  10-foot cone. You may only use this ability once
  per transformation.
- Whenever a creature deals damage to you, you
  gain one level of enraged towards that creature. If
  another creature deals damage to you, remove all
  other levels of enraged gained from this ability.
- You have advantage on skill checks to
  intimidate others.
  You remain in this form until you spend your
  action to return to your human form.

Ulvsjael (Wolf C h i ldr e n)
The ulvsjael are human descendants of Ulvma,
the wolf mother and the second child of the Gaea.
When Shara Bolasi died in his duel against
Hykravones, Nagatayora had descended into
madness, Ulvma stayed back with the armies of
Alaria and fought till the very end before being cut
down and collapsing into the ground amongst the
armies. When humans came and drank from her
blood, the Ulvsjael were born.
The Ulvsjael are a pragmatic and fiercely loyal
race who believe in the natural order of life. Much of
life revolves around small, nomadic units which
travel as a pack. They will protect their comrades
with their own lives, but they also feel no qualms
about keeping those who cannot defend themselves
alive. If you cannot contribute, you are culled. This
harsh outlook is even more brutal towards outsiders,
who are usually seen as dead weight until they have
proven their worthiness to their pack. However,
when the Ulvsjael themselves is the outsider—a rare
appearance, due to their tendency to stick with their
kind—they are frequently the hardest working, such
is their desire to prove their usefulness to a new
community.
Ulvsjael can be found across Alaria, and are
known for their formidable mercenary groups,
trackers, and explorers.
