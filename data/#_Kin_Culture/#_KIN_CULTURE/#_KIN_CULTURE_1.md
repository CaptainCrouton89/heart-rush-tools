  things that can be smelt or heard.
- Your move speed increases by 40 feet.

  and slashing melee weapons, respectively.

Sharabha (Li o n H e a r t s)

Sharabha are the children of Shara Bolasi, the
great lion father and third child of Gaea. When
Hykravones first arrived on Alaria, Shara Bolasi was
the first to step forward, alone, to make a stand
against the powerful titan. In the terrible ensuing
battle, Shara Bolasi was slowly beaten down, before
at last, Hykravones stepped forward and ripped
Shara Bolasi’s heart out through his chest, before
stomping it beneath his foot. Millenia later, when
people had settled across Alaria once more, the
humans who ate from the soil there became the first
Sharabha.
Sharabha are known for their warmth,
compassion, and incredible honor. In Sharabha

```
communities, a lying Sharabha is an exiled
Sharabha. The leaders of Sharabha prides, as they are
sometimes called, are usually the strongest, most
respected member of a pride. They will make
unilateral decisions for the pride until a new leader is
chosen.
Outside these communities, Sharabha who have
willingly left do not practice many of their more
traditional rituals, but maintain their fierce sense of
principles and morality.

```
Aspect of the Lion
Major ability.
You may channel your blood of Shara Bolasi,
and transform into a lion-like form. Your head
morphs into the head of a lion and claws grow on
your hands. While in this form, you gain the
following traits:
```

- Your jaws count as a heavy piercing weapon.
  Your claws count as light slashing weapons.
- Whenever you deal damage with your jaws to
  an enemy, you may choose to not let go. If you do,
  and if the creature is no more than one size larger
  than you, the creature takes a level of restrained
  until it spends its action and wins a might check
  against your might challenge number. While
  holding on, you cannot attack with your jaws
  again. Both you and the bitten creature have your
  move speeds reduced by half, and move together.
- You cannot hold a weapon or shield or
  manipulate fine objects.
- You are immune to the frightened condition.
  You remain in this form until you spend your
  action to return to your human form.

Elf

Elves are a race of fiercely independent, ancient,
culturally rich people. With lifespans five times the
length of a humans’, elves have a much broader
perspective on life and the world around them, and a
lot more time to explore and refine their passions.
Wars, politics, and the frivolities of other races are
far less important to most elven cultures.

Vitals

- Height: 5-6.5 feet
- Weight: 100-180 pounds

Years of Experience

_Passive ability._
Gaining additional or upgrading your aspects
costs 2 less XP, for a minimum of 1, and your
maximum rank for each of your aspects is increased
by 3.

Amverela (High Elf)

The Amverela are the most prolific and long-
living of the elves, and most interactive with the
other inhabitants of Alaria. Partially due to their long
life times, but especially due to their extreme
wisdom, passion, and expertise, the Amverela are
some of the longest running ethnic identities among
all people on Alaria—having survived numerous
cataclysmic events, wars, and famines while
remaining relatively culturally intact.
They place a higher value on investing in
themselves, their relationships, and their
communities. This has led them to building some of
the most magnificent cities in Alaria—utopian, by
most standards.

```
The Amverela can be found across Alaria, and
are known for their extraordinary skill in all aspects
of life.
```

```

```
Caerene (Wood Elf)
The Caerene have darker, more olive skin than
their Zaelian and Amverela cousins, allowing them
to more easily blend into the forests in which they
usually live.
Caerene are far more isolating than many other
races, preferring to remain unbothered by the trivial,
day-to-day grievances and turmoil of most life on
Alaria. For that reason, most populations have found
hard to reach or find locations as well as methods of
hiding and blending in with their natural
surroundings. An unobservant individual walking
through the middle of a Caerene village may not
even be aware anyone is around—so skillful are the
Caerene.
Most Caerene culture emphasizes finding
balance in nature, and preserving that balance. They
place a lot of significance on fate, fairness, and
immediate justice. There are no second chances in
Caerene culture.
