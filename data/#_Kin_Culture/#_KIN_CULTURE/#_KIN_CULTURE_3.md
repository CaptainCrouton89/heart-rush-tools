## # KIN & CULTURE

individuals increased drastically, enhancing the
population’s ability to mine and control their
environment underground.
However, underground life also came with
several hardships. Fish, fungi, and insects are nearly
the only things alive besides the monsters from the
deep, and little airflow and high temperatures deep
underground require complex air circulation systems
in place. The Uline have gotten around this latter
problem by implementing networks of air vents
leading to the surface, manipulated through long
chains, giving them their nickname of chain
dwarves.
Even more difficult to deal with were the
shadereavers and other monstrosities from the dark.
While the Aureum dwarves invented huge mirrored
passageways into the depths of the caves, using the
sun’s light to protect themselves from the creatures
of the dark, the Uline resorted to iron. To this day,
children are taught from a young age how to wield
the heavy iron blades and hammers used to defend
themselves from the monsters of the dark.
Living underground has shaped the Uline into a
rough, tough, and pragmatic group, but they are
usually goodnatured, and even sometimes downright
jolly. However, it is unwise to get into an argument
with most Uline; the Uline have done things in the
same way for thousands of years, and change is not
something many of them are welcome to. When
disagreement does arise, arbitrage usually falls on
higher ranking individuals within the community,
who will have final say.

Au r e u m (Su n Dwarf)
In the early days of the Uline, when no more than
a few underground settlements existed, an upwelling
of shadereavers from deep below nearly wiped out
the underground population. Immediately, multiple
factions emerged proposing different ways to avoid
such catastrophes in the future. One of these such
factions determined that nothing but the light of the
sun could shield them from such monstrosities, and
swore to find a way to brings the sun’s light into the
depths of the Uline caves. While many of the Uline
thought this was impossible, and rejected the idea,
some latched on, and the Aureum were born.
The Aureum use complex systems of mirrors and
glass to illuminate their underground settlements
with the warm glow of sunlight. Within a few more
centuries, they had also discovered the secret to
storing liquid sunlight, keeping them safe even when
night came. Now, this liquid sunlight is smelted into
much of their armor and weapons, and keeps them
strong, and as they now believe, pure.
Aureum culture emphasizes law, honor, and
truth. When the Aureum first broke away from the
Uline, their leader, Aurea herself, promised to keep
her people safe, so long as her followers trusted her,
and followed her commands. They did, and she
carried through—permanently cementing the
importance of a promise and following one’s leader.

Su nsmith
_Major ability._
As an Aureum, you are privy to the secret
methods of extracting liquid sunlight from the sun’s
rays, and you always have a flask of sunlight
available. It emits light out to 10 feet, and dim light
for 10 feet beyond that. You may use this flask for
any one of the following abilities:

- Health and Rejuvenation. As an interact action,
  you may drink the flask and gain the benefits of a
  short rest.
- Smash. As an interact action, you may crush or
  throw your flask to cast _Blinding Sun_.
  Once you have used your flask, you cannot do so
  again until you spend 10 minutes in private at sunrise
  or sunset to capture the sun’s rays. The sunlight
  within a flask expires after 12 hours.
