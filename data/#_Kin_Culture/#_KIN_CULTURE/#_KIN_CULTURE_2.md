Drasnian (Stout Dwarf)

Drasnian dwarves are the eldest and by far most
populous of the dwarven heritages, dating back to
before the Uline dwarves went underground.
Drasnians are generally a stout, serious bunch, with
softer features than their other dwarven cousins, and
live almost exclusively above ground or in homes
built into hillsides. They have a long history of both
prosperity and destitution, and through economic
trade, fleeing war and persecution, and enslavement,
have made it all over Alaria. Drasnians can be found
in vast numbers at nearly any cultural hub, as well as
in several countries where Drasnians have settled
down in large numbers, including Drasnia itself, the
believed birthplace of the Drasnians.
As a whole, they value education, money, and
preserving their cultural and religious legacy.
Drasnian culture is rich with customs dictating
worship, relationships, and one’s day-to-day life.

Uline (Chain Dwarf)
The Uline originated from a particularly
productive iron mine, many thousands of years ago.
The mine, which had struck a rich vein of ore was so
vast and deep that it would inevitably take more than
a generation to complete. Rather than journey to and
from the surface daily, they discovered that it was
more efficient to temporarily station some dwarves
within the mines for days, or even weeks at a time.
With time, these temporary stations became more
permanent residencies, and eventually, entire
settlements. These dwarves became the Uline—
named after the settlement that grew up in that first
mine. Today, the Uline are the most industrious of
the dwarves, preferring to live underground, mining,
and making their homes in the mountains beneath
the surface.
Living underground came with several
unexpected effects, that the Uline now embrace or
have adapted to. Beneath the surface, there are few
people who can interfere with a settlement’s growth.
Defense from invaders is easier when underground,
which has allowed the Uline to allocate more
resources towards magnificent palaces, inventions,
and other intellectual efforts. Additionally, within a
single generation, the number of earth attuned
