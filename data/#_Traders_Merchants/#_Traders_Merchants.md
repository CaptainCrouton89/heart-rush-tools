# # Traders & Merchants

Money is what makes the world go around, and
in the world of Alaria, it is no different. If you are
interested in making money at a large scale through
trade, this section is for you.

Making Money

Every settlement has an economy around buying
and selling roughly the same goods. For example,
almost everyone needs food and clothing, and most
settlements also need stone, lumber, beer, salt, and a
large number of other “core” resources. However,
some settlements are producers of those goods, or
are adjacent to one, and therefore have a surplus of
that good, and others have deficits of that good, and
therefore have high demand for that good. This is
where you come in.

Prices

Every settlement has a rating for its size, which
determines how many buyers and sellers there are, as
well as at what level. Then, for every common good
(see the _Common Goods_ table below), there is a level
of need. This reflects if this good is in demand, or in
surplus, and at what level of magnitude. The rating is
secretly determined by the GM, but will reflect
availability of that good in the area. Also note that a
settlement will only ever have demand or surplus for
a good—never both (since then those people would
just trade amongst themselves until there was no
more surplus or demand). This rating determines the
price of any given good within a settlement.

```
To find that price, look at the demand/surplus
modifier for that good. If the good is in demand,
multiply the price of the good by this number. If the
good is in surplus, divide the good’s price by this
number. The end result is the approximate price for
that good in that location. While you, as a merchant,
may (and should) approximate this value yourself,
the “true” value is determined, and held secretly, by
the GM.
```

```
Bu yers and Sellers
In order to take advantage of this price, you must
be able to find buyers and sellers. Even if individual
people want to buy or sell some good, you cannot
turn profit by making individual sales—you must
buy or sell in bulk. For this, usually only
shopkeepers and other local merchants can be your
customers.
To determine the number of buyers or sellers in a
settlement, the GM should first look at the good you
are interested in buying or selling. If it is in surplus
in this settlement, there are only sellers. In contrast,
if there is demand for this good, then there are only
buyers. If the rating is 0, then there are an equal
division of buyers and sellers (rounded in either
direction, at GM discretion). Then, take the value in
the bonus traders column of the Surplus & Demand
table, and add it to the value listed in the buyers/
sellers column of the Settlements table.
For example, if furs were in moderate demand
(1d4 - 1) in a small town (+1), then the number of
buyers would be equal to 1d4. Or, for example, if
bricks were in extreme surplus (1d4 + 1) in a hamlet
(+0), then the number of sellers would be equal to
```

1d4 + 1. Or, if honey was neutral (1d4 - 3) in a
metropolis (+4), then there would be 1d4 + 1 buyers
and sellers, split evenly between the two.

Securing a Buyer or Seller

When you come to a settlement, you can choose
to spend a day looking for a buyer or seller of a
particular good. That time is spent perusing shops,
visiting guilds, and performing more general
information gathering techniques. While this part of
the day will likely not be played out, actually
meeting the buyer or seller will.
When you meet a buyer or seller, the GM will
roll a die equal to the value in the buyer/seller level
column of the _Settlement_ table, and then add your
influence, up to the maximum level listed in the max
level column. This is the level of the trader, and
represents how many units of goods they may be
willing to buy or sell to you at the given price. From
this point on, it is up to you to secure a price you
want. Although an approximate base price has been
calculated by the GM using the supply/demand table,
it is up to you to find the best deal that you can.
Once you have agreed upon a price, you may
transfer a number of goods to the trader up to or
equal to their level, and get paid your agreed upon
price.
If you wish, you may continue looking for buyers
and sellers of the same good, or you may look for a
buyer or seller of a different good. In either case, this
still takes a day, and follows the same process.
Once you have a made a deal with a one or more
buyers or sellers in a settlement, you may always
return to that settlement to make the exact same
exchange of money for goods, once per month. You
do not need to find new buyers or sellers, and you do
not have to haggle for a new price (though you may
do either of these things if you wish). Although a
trader may disappear, or wish to renegotiate prices,

```
this will not typically happen except when the GM
decides it makes sense.
```

```
Tr a de R ou t e s
At the heart of being a successful merchant is
identifying and exploiting lucrative trade routes.
While it’s possible for a trader to constantly travel,
buying and selling whatever they deem fit, it is much
better to automate this so that the merchant’s time
can be spent elsewhere. This automation takes the
form of trade routes.
Trade routes are cyclical paths connecting a
collection of settlements, in which the starting and
ending settlement are the same, and the quantity of
purchases and sales in every settlement along the
way remains in equilibrium with each pass through
the cycle.
Although there are no specific rules dictating
special properties of trade routes, it is heavily
recommended that you develop them, as they allow
you assign the job of actually traveling between
settlements and executing the trades to someone else.
In order to count as a trade route, there must not
be any sort renegotiating on prices and quantities for
each good at each stop in the trade route, and there
must be a settlement of origin, where your trade
route begins and ends. Once this has been confirmed,
your trade route’s profit can be calculated by looking
at the total revenue from completing a trade route
and then subtracting the maintenance costs for
whatever vehicles were used for that time. This
money can then be picked up from your settlement
of origin after each cycle of the trade route is
completed.

Milestones
As you improve as a trader, you unlock certain
benefits, due to a combination of your influence,
```

wealth, and experience. Each milestone is unlocked
once you achieve its prerequisite achievements.

Tr a de r: Novice

_Establish 20 miles worth of trade routes._
You know how to identify who’s more likely to
buy or sell a lot. When you enter a new settlement,
you may ask the GM to roll the level for each buyer
or seller in the settlement, and announce their levels
to you. You may meet them in any order.

Tr a de r: Amateur
_Establish 100 miles worth of trade routes._

```
Your minimum influence level becomes two.
```

Tr a de r: Professional

_Establish 500 miles worth of trade routes_
You have gained an intuition about where pirates
and thieves may lie. You have A3 on all checks to
predict their presence, including when you research a
trade route as well as while actually traveling it.
Your minimum influence level becomes three.

Tr a de r: Expert

_Establish 2,000 miles worth of trade routes._
You can find a better deal on most things. If you
find an item being sold, if it is not a unique item, and
it costs less than 50,000 ducat, roll 1d100. If you roll
under 50, you know someone else who’s selling it at
a price at that percentage discount on the price you
originally found. The GM will tell you their name
and how you know how to contact them.You may
use this ability once per month.
For example, if you found a magical knife that
costed 40,000 ducat, you could use this ability and
roll 1d100. If you rolled a 25, then the GM would
tell you that you actually know a friend, “Andre”
who sells that exact item for 30,000 (40,000 - 25% x
40,000). The GM will tell you how you know (or

```
know of ) this person, as well as where they are and
how you could contact them.
You may use this ability on bulk purchases as
well, so long as each individual item of the bulk
purchase costs less than 50,000.
Additionally, your minimum influence level
becomes four.
```

```
Tr a de r: Master
Establish 10,000 miles worth of trade routes.
You have connections everywhere. If an item is
on the market in any of the markets your trade route
touches, you can use your trade network to locate a
buyer or a seller. You may use this ability any
number of times for items that not unique, and only
once per month for unique items.
Additionally, your minimum influence level
becomes five.
```

Complications &

Other Factors

```
These rules outline what things will look like
when everything is going nicely. However, there are
several other factors to consider when implemented
in an actual game.
```

```
Ta x e s
Taxes are a huge concern for merchants, and
they’re often a pain to avoid. Most cities and large
ports have tariffs on imported resources. These
usually range from 2–5% of imported value, but their
exact rates are us up to the GM, as well as if they
exist at all. Fortunately, bribes, smuggling, and other
trickery can be used to get around these. As a player,
```

it is up to you to decide if you want to avoid these,
and if so, how.

Weather

The second bane of the merchant lifestyle is the
weather. Weather can lead to delays, damaged
shipments, or no shipments at all, such as if a ship
sinks at sea. When the GM approximates the time it
takes from one settlement to another, they should
take this into account. In addition, if you are
traveling some place where shipments could be
damaged, the GM may choose to place a percentage
loss on profits based off of how likely they estimate
these damages to occur.
Lastly, the GM may decide that weather has
caused an entire shipment to disappear. Usually, this
is cause for player investigation, but if you are
shipping goods through a dangerous area, this may
just be a cost of doing business.

```
Pirates & Thieves
The last thorn in the side of merchants come
from the pirates and thieves who steal merchandise
in transit. As with weather, this may just be a
constant cost to your shipments, or, it may be a
source of further adventure. The GM should think
carefully about where pirates and thieves reside, and
where and how they go about stealing.
