# # Magical Crafting

Any bit of magical crafting begins with its
components—a collection of magically potent
materials that will be combined to create the product.
Metals, gems, bloods, powders, horns, teeth, and
hides are all examples of potential magical
components.
Every component has two properties, each
determined at the GM’s discretion. First is its level.
This determines how powerful of an effect that
material can create. Second are its tags. Tags are
used to describe the type of magical ability
associated with a material. For example, pixie dust
could be a magical component. The GM may then
decide that it is a level 4 component with the tags
“psychic”, “air”, and “illusion”. The GM may also
decide that they want silver to be a level 2 magical
substance, and because they don't think it has any
specific magical properties, give it the “neutral” tag.
The GM should refer to the following sections to
determine the power level and tags of a component.
For examples of magic items, and their level and
tags, refer to Appendix C.

Power Level

The power level table is used for determining the
level of magical items as well as their components.
When determining the power level of a component,
the GM should assign it a level corresponding to the
highest power level one could feasibly achieve if the
component was the most critical component to an
item’s function. For example, let’s assign the power
level to a unicorn horn. As the GM, imagine that the
most powerful item we think the horn could
reasonably be used as the center piece for was a

```
“unicorn horn wand” that could powerfully charm
multiple people at a time. With this vague idea in
mind, we can assign it a power level of 4, since that’s
roughly the power level of that wand.
```

```
Tag s
The tags table is used for determining which tags
belong to a component. With the exception of the
“neutral” tag, all tags have a specific flavor of magic.
If a component feels like it meets the description for
a tag, that tag belongs on the component. For any
material or component that feels like it might be used
```

```
Power Level
Le v e l Power Level Description
1 Not powerful. More cosmetic, or flavorful
than anything else. +1 bonus to skill
checks..
2 The power of a talent. Roughly 2.5 damage
per round, or a +2 bonus to skill checks.
3 The power of a talent with its destiny level.
Roughly 5 damage per round, or a +3
bonus to skill checks.
4 A substantially powerful effect, such as a
paragon level. Roughly 8 damage per
round, or a +5 bonus to skill checks.
5 An incredible effect, but not one that could
be described as legendary. Multiple
paragon levels, for example. Roughly 20
damage per round.
6 Wondrous effects, potentially able to
instantly kill commoners. Not necessarily
one-of-a-kind, but probably. Their locations
are likely known throughout history—they
are viewed as legendary artifacts.
7 Beyond legendary.
```

in a magic item, but it doesn’t necessarily have a
specific use, it should likely receive the “neutral”
tag. For example, as the GM, if you want precious
metals and gems to be prevalent in all sorts of
magical items, they should have the “neutral” tag.

Crafting the Item

```
Before you can begin crafting the item, you must
first determine if you are following a procedure or if
you are inventing. If you have a blueprint, plan, or
recipe, or have one memorized, then you are
following a procedure. If you’ve never made
something before and are hoping to create a desired
effect, then you are inventing. Each involves
different steps.
```

```
Following Procedure
When following procedure, the GM will tell you
the level of the item you are crafting and the required
components. You must have each of the required
components, and you must have an aspect related to
crafting of rank equal to or greater than the level of
the item you are creating. Proceed to the Crafting
Check section.
```

```
Inventing
When inventing, the details of what you are
trying to make need to be ironed out first. Describe
to the GM what you want to make. Work with them
to determine the exact details of what the magical
item does, how often it can be used, and any other
properties of the item. As the player, it is ultimately
up to you to determine the stats of the item you wish
to create. With the stats clearly defined, the GM

```

```
Tag Description
```

should then determine the power level of the
described item using the _Power Level_ chart. This
process should be collaborative between the player
and GM.
After determining the level, the GM should
decide what types of components the item requires.
An item recipe should require at least one
component with a tag relating to each unique effect
of the item, and should require a total number of
components equal to the level of the item. If the total
number of specific types of components don’t sum to
the level of the item, the remaining components
should be neutral components. All components must
be of an equal or greater level than the crafted item
itself.

Crafting

Once you have determined the level and the tags
of the magic item, you can attempt to craft it. For
each tag on the magic item, you must have a
corresponding, distinct component of level equal or
greater than the level of the magic item you are
trying to craft. You must also have an aspect of rank
equal to or greater than the level of the item you are
creating.

Crafting Check

You have the necessary ingredients, it is now
time to actually make the item. Successfully crafting
an item requires X successful crafting skill checks,

```
where X is the level of the item you are trying to
craft. Crafting must also be done in a crafting
workshop, of level equal to or greater than the level
of the item being crafted. After every X days you
spend working in the workshop, make the crafting
skill check. The CN is equal to 8 + 2 * X.
On a failed skill check, progress for that period
of work does not count—you must work another X
days to make another check. On three consecutive
failed skill checks, the item is ruined, all progress is
lost, and a random component is wasted in the
process.
However, once you have a number of successful
crafting checks equal to the level of the item, you
have finished.
```

```
Following Procedure
If you were following a procedure, it is much
easier to make craft an item without making
mistakes. You have a +8 on your crafting skill
checks.
```

```
Inventing
If you were inventing, make one final crafting
skill check upon completing an item, representing
your skill as an inventor. On a success, you have
crafted the item with the desired effects. If you fail,
you have still successfully crafted a magical item,
but it does not have the exact intended behavior. It is
entirely up to the GM what the properties are of the
magic item you have created.
```

```
Refining Components
Sometimes the components you have are not
high enough level to make what you want. If this is
the case, you may wish to use alchemy to refine a
component into a shard. A shard is a purer form of a
magical material, distilled to its magical essence.
```

```
Example
Let’s say you want to craft a fiery great sword.
You describe it as giving a creature one level of
burning whenever you deal damage to it with the
sword. The GM would determine that this is of
roughly level 3, and would have the tag “fire” but
nothing else. It would therefore require one level 3
fire component, and two level 3 neutral components.
```

To craft shard you must have two, non-shard
materials of the same level and with the same tags,
and you must have access to an alchemy lab of level
equal to or greater than the level of the components
for the duration of the refinement. You may then
spend a number of days refining equal to the level of
the components. After those days, both components
are destroyed and you gain a shard—a magical
component with the same tags as its ingredients, and
of one higher level. Components with only a neutral
tag cannot be refined into shards, and shards cannot
be refined into more shards.

Crafting

Wor kshop

```
In order to craft magical items, it is necessary to
have at least some type of workshop dedicated to the
task. A workshop contains all the necessary tools,
reference materials, and specialized workstations
necessary for magical crafting. Every workstation
has a level. Higher level workstations are larger and
more expensive, but can make it easier to craft
magical items.
The following table contains the requirements for
each level of workshop. Required equipment is
cumulative, so each level of workshop requires all
the tools necessary from each previous level.

Item Description Cost

Animal Products

In most cases of magical crafting, the
components will come from animals. Below are the
most commonly used animal parts used in magical
crafting.
In order to harvest items from a creature, you
will likely have to make a harvest check with a CN
set by the GM. The difficulty of this will vary by
product and creature.

Le a t h e r

Hides can be used for armors and some crafting.
Nearly all hides can be fashioned into light or
medium armors, though some will also work as
heavy armor.

Feathers

Feathers provide very little protection, but
magically aided abilities in flight are sometimes held
within a creature’s feathers.

Scale s

Scales are much harder to harvest than leather,
but can be used in both armors as well as some
crafting.

Fangs, Spines & Horns

Fangs, spines, and horns can usually be crafted
into piercing melee weapons. In the case of
particularly straight edges, they can also be used as
arrowheads.

Claws & Talons

Claws and talons can be crafted into slashing
weapons. Usually the weapons cannot be heavy, as
the slashing area is relatively small.

```
Bones
Bones are versatile. They can be shaped into
weapons or trinkets, or they can be ground up and
used as powders in alchemy. Usually bones do not
possess much magical capacity, though if there is
any, it is usually concentrated in the creature’s skull.
```

```
Blood
Blood can be used in crafting potions, or it can
be dried and used as a powder or paste applied
during crafting. In the case of magical creatures, the
potion may grant the drinker some of the properties
of the creature during its life.
```

```
Heart
Like blood, the heart may be used in potion
crafting. In some cases, the heart can also be used for
crafting by harvesting the heart-strings. The heart is
generally more potent than the blood. Sometimes,
the heart might have some magical effects even if the
blood does not.
```

```
Brain
In creatures with powerful mind effects, the brain
can sometimes be used in potion crafting to capture
some of the creature’s magical ability.
```

```
Vocal C hords
In creatures with magically superior voices,
vocal chords can be harvested to capture some of the
creature’s magical ability.
```

```
Eyes
In creatures with magically superior sense of
sight, the eyes can usually be harvested to capture
some of the creature’s magical ability. They can
either be ground up for alchemy, or petrified in use
with crafting.
```

Venoms, Poisons & Toxins

Venoms, poisons, and toxins can be turned into
poisons and contact poisons. Some can also be
turned into poisonous gasses. Most creatures can
produce one dose of poison per day while alive, and
can have 3 doses harvested off of them on death.

Ink

Some creatures produce ink, such as octopus.
besides more mundane uses, such as for writing or
art, the ink may have magical properties that can be
used in alchemy or crafting.

Te ar s

Tears are some of the most difficult and taboo
alchemical components to procure, as they require

```
the creature to be alive and crying when they are
harvested. However, some of the most powerful
magic is occasionally held within a creature’s tears.
```

```
Hooves
The hooves of a creature with magical movement
speed may contain some magical power.
```

```
high level smithing requires a “god forge”,
something-crucible
Alchemy: Something-crucible.
```

All possible properties, as well as a brief
description of each can be found below:

The first is that all crafting has a difficulty. The
difficulty is a CN which determines how challenging
that item is to make.
The second is a duration. Different items take
different amounts of time to craft.
Lastly is a material cost. Material is measured in
weight, and is used up when you craft items.

The first thing to know is that the magic of
magical crafting comes from the components of the
objects made. Unlike Deoric or Kethic, making
magical items does not require any magical
capability of the crafter—it uses the magic entirely
from its materials.

Smithing

```
Smithing is the general descriptor for any sort of
forging, smithing, or crafting of weapons, shields, or
armor. For example, a bone mask that provides a
bonus to defense, an arrow made of a basilisk spine,
and a shield of astral steel are all examples of
smithing.
If you want to make something that falls under
the category of smithing, then there are three
important values to know—the
Use the following table to calculate the smithing
difficulty, time to craft, and material mass required.
To determine the difficulty, take the difficulty and
add any modifiers for the item type that applies. For
example, a heavy, bludgeoning, stone club would be
calculated as follows:
7 (base CN for adapting) + 1 (material cost) + 2
(heavy weight) + 0 (bludgeoning) + 0 (melee) = 10.
```

```

```

Light +0 x0.25 x1

Heavy +1 x0.5 x2

Alchemy

Alchemy is the process of transforming raw
ingredients into magical substances. Brewing
potions, refining magical components, and
concocting arcane substances are all examples of
alchemy. For example, making poisons, explosives,
and invisibility paint are all examples of alchemy.
Alchemy differs from artificing in that the
alchemical products are used up rather than sticking
around forever.
Despite this difference, the rules of alchemy are
nearly identical to those of magical crafting. The
level of your final product is estimated, tags are
determined, and components with corresponding
level and tags are used to produce a final product.
Differences are laid out below.

Inventing

Whenever you produce something new via
alchemy, you must determine how much of the
product you intend to create. By default, you
produce 10 uses of that item. For example, if you are
making a poison, you have 10 doses of that poison.
If you are producing flash bangs, you make 10 flash
bangs. In cases with more vague units of
measurements (such as invisibility paint) it is up to
you as the player, though it must be approved by the
GM.

Alchemy Laboratory

In order to perform alchemy, you must have the
tools, space, and knowledge to do so. All of those
things are centered in your laboratory—necessary for
any alchemical experiment.
While working in an alchemy lab, you get a
bonus to all alchemy checks equal to the level of the
lab.

```
Le v e l 1
At level 1, you need basic alchemy tools, and 2
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 2
At level 2, you need basic alchemy tools, and 5
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 3
At level 3, you need advanced alchemy tools,
and 10 or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 4
At level 4, you need advanced alchemy tools,
and 20 or more alchemy books.
```

```
Le v e l 5
At level 5, you need expert alchemy tools, and 40
or more alchemy books.
```

```
Crafting
In order to craft an alchemical brew, you must
spend time and resources to prepare the substance. In
addition, you must have access to the recipe, either
from a book, or memorized, and you must be in an
alchemy lab of a level equal or greater than the
recipe you are crafting.
When you wish to craft something, it takes a
number of days equal to the recipe’s level. Only two
hours each day must be spent actively working on
the recipe, since the rest of the time is spent waiting
for chemical reactions to occur. If you do not have
the recipe memorized, you must have access to a
written form of the recipe each day.
When you start the crafting process, remove all
the required remarkable materials from your
inventory. Those materials are used up in the
alchemy process. Any gold cost in addition to the
unique materials is spent at a rate of 10 * X ducat at
```

the start of each day, where X is the level of the
alchemical product.
After each day of crafting, make an alchemy skill
check against 8 + 2 \* X, where X is the level of the
recipe. On a success, you make another day of
progress towards finishing the product, potentially
finishing the product immediately. On a failure, all
progress is lost, and you ruin the product.

Recipes

In order to craft an alchemical solution, you must
know the recipe, or be able to follow a recipe from a
book. Memorizing a recipe takes a number of
successful daily memorization checks equal to the
recipe’s level. The CN for the memorization check is
equal to 8 + 2 \* X, where X is the recipe’s level.

Inventing Alchemy

As you progress as an alchemist, you may gain
the ability to invent alchemical products. If you do,
you may work with your GM to define the
properties, costs, remarkable materials, and levels of
any alchemical product. As a player, your
responsibility is to define the properties of a
hypothetical alchemical product. As the GM, their
responsibility is to determine if such a product could
even exist, and if so, to assign it its costs, material
requirements, and level.

Assigning Materials and Level

To determine the level and materials required for
an alchemical product, its level should be equal to
the number of special materials in the product or the
maximum level of the materials used in the product,
whichever is higher.

Le v e l 1

```
Level 1 Magical Substance Preparation
Most magical resources harvested require some
sort of alchemical processing to occur before they
