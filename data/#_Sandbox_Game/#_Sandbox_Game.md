When players make a decision, there are a lot of
things that could theoretically happen. Do not
prepare them. Instead, choose the one that’s the most
interesting, given the situation.

For sandbox: the env. challenge is the world.
Some people in the world are pursuing goal. The
motivation exists for someone. There is a mystery.

For identifying good GM tips in dnd:
Find examples of what things are done well.
Figure out what they have in common.
Make a rule that forces you to replicate that
effect with the least "extra work" as possible.

Ex. Blindness disease, Befriend evil prince,
Murky depths of jewels, whispers in ears of evil
voice, finding lost relative

Blindness disease caused by deal horrible prince
has made with demon from the bejeweled depths.
Demon steals sight and in exchange has promised to
find prince’s brother. Creepy voice comes from
demon, who’s power grows. Prince found demon,
got the voice, made deal. Voices asking for more
deals. You make determination for population, they
pay price.
Artifact: doomstone—indecipherable prophecy
of this demon’s return. Written by scholars of time,
forgotten language. Explains that can be killed when
all those pray to him are dead. True name known,
exists here.
Learn words for “dies”. Big sacrifice necessary.
Factions: prince’s supporters. Political faction,
brought him to power, he removed safeguards.
Prince is nationalist, built better schools. Game
begins with school building by prince. Prince is
using money from taxing the rich (destroying
opponents)Political opponents: They are rich
schmucks. Want prince gone, but treason is
executable.

Wilderness Travel

When traveling long distances where the travel
itself is dangerous and a point of adventure, special
rules go into effect. In this mode of gameplay, time
progresses in blocks of time, split into the four
quarters of the day: morning, afternoon, evening, and
night. Each quarter can be spent traveling or
camping.
While traveling, you are moving towards your
destination. For each quarter of the day you spend
traveling, you cover a number of miles equal to half
of your travel speed. Additionally, for each quarter
spent traveling, you may take one action with the
_travel_ tag from the Journey Actions section below.
While camping, you are recovering from your
travels and preparing for the next leg of the journey.

```
For each quarter spent camping, you may take one
action with the camp tag from the Journey Actions
section below.
```

```
Journey Actions
While traveling, you can take one journey action
for each quarter of the day, so long as its tag
corresponds to what you're doing during that quarter.
Some journey actions have both a travel and a camp
tag, meaning you can always take the action. All
players should determine which journey action they
want to take before they are resolved.
Most actions require you to make a skill check
agains the environment. Below is a chart defining the
challenge numbers for different journey actions in
different environments. The GM may adjust these
CNs based on additional factors.
```

When you take a journey action at night, it's
substantially harder to do it effectively. Any skill
checks made for a journey action taken during the
night quarter have D2. If you are traveling during the
night, you travel half as far.
The journey actions are listed below:

```
Captain
Travel.
You manage and steer your vehicle. If you are on
a vehicle, someone on the vehicle must take this
action. Make a CN 8 skill check relevant to piloting

your vehicle. On a failure, you travel half as far this
quarter.
Only one person can take this action each
quarter.

Entertain

_Travel. Camp._
You keep morale up, by singing, sharing stories,
or entertaining in some other way. Make a CN 8
entertainment skill check. On a success, grant
someone else a destiny point. If you beat the CN by
four points or more, grant two DP instead.

Fish

_Camp._
You go fishing. You must have fishing gear and
be near a body of water to take this action.
Make a fishing skill check against the challenge
number for the environment. On a success, you catch
two rations worth of food. For every point over the
CN, you catch two additional rations worth of food.

Forage
_Travel. Camp._
You look for edible plants, roots, and berries.
Make a foraging skill check against the challenge
number for the environment. If you use this as a
travel action, you have disadvantage on this roll. On
a success, you find six rations. For every point over
the CN, you find one additional ration worth of food.

Gather Wood
_Camp._

You look for dry wood or other flammables to
build a fire. Make a search skill check against the
challenge number for the environment. On a success,
you gather one bundle of wood (enough to keep a
small fire burning for a quarter). If you beat the CN
by four or more, you gather two bundles of wood

```
(enough to keep a large fire burning for one quarter,
or a small fire burning for two quarters).
```

```
Hunt
Travel. Camp.
You track down and kill a wild animal for food.
You must have a light or heavy ranged weapon with
a range of 30 feet or greater to take this action.
Make a tracking skill check against the
challenge number for the environment. If you use
this as a travel action, you have disadvantage on this
roll. On a success, you find a prey animal worth 2
rations of food, typical to the surrounding terrain, if
any exist. If you beat the CN by four or more, the
animal you find is worth 20 rations instead. You may
then make a hunting skill check against the challenge
number for the environment. On a success, you kill
the animal before it gets away.
```

```
Lo o k o u t
Travel. Camp.
You keep watch while moving, or explore the
surroundings around your camp. Make a perception
skill check against the challenge number for your
environment. On a success, you see or hear any
threats as soon as they become visible or audible. If
you beat the CN by four points or more, you spot
something interesting while searching, as determined
by the GM.
```

```
Navigate
Travel. Camp.
You use charts and your surroundings to keep
track of where you are. If someone does not take this
action while in a travel phase, you may become lost
at the GM’s discretion.
When you take this action, make a navigation
check against the challenge number for the
environment. On a failure, you are lost. Add an
additional event to the journey. The GM should roll
```

on the _Lost in the Wilderness_ table to determine the
outcome.

Scou t A he ad
_Travel._
If scouting ahead is feasible, you may take this
action. Make a scouting skill check against the
environment's challenge number. On a success,
choose one of the following journey actions:
Captain, Fish, Gather Wood, Forage, Hunt, Make
Camp, or Navigate. During the next quarter, skill
checks made for the chosen journey action have
advantage.

Sleep
_Camp. Travel\*._
When you take this action, you may take a long
rest. Make your sleeping check. If you take this
action during a quarter of the day other than the
night, you have -20 on this roll.
You can sleep while traveling if you are not on
foot. You have -30 to the sleeping check.

Interruptions in the Journey

If you get into a fight, explore something you
discovered, or take part in any lengthy activity that
the GM rules is not part of the journey, the journey
actions pause. When they resume, the GM may start
at whatever quarter they deem appropriate.

Getting Lost

When you are lost, rather than going in the
intended direction, you cover the same distance in a
cardinal direction determined by 1d4 (1: North, 2:
East, 3: South, 4: West). So long as you are lost,
quarters spent traveling continue to be in random
directions.
You remain lost until you succeed at a _navigate_
journey action.

Carrying Gear

```
When you travel, you will likely want to bring
your gear. These rules break down how much gear
you can carry and what happens when you try to
carry more.
```

```
Encumbrance Score
There are several critical points of burden. Your
first critical point of carrying capacity is your
encumbrance score. This is equal to half of your
might die times 10, and it dictates how many pounds
of gear you can carry without any penalty.
Once you surpass that amount, however, you
become encumbered. While encumbered, for every
10 pounds over your encumbrance threshold,
rounded up, your movement speed is reduced by 5
feet.
```

```
Maximum Carrying Capacity
Your second critical point of burden is your
maximum carrying capacity, equal to your might die
times 10. Although you can lift more than this, you
cannot carry this much for a full quarter of the day.
```

```
Pac k A n i m al s & Vehicles
Rather than carrying all of your gear on your
back, using a pack animal or vehicle can help. Use
the following chart to determine the carrying
capacity. If you are riding the animal, remember to
subtract your own weight as well.
Carrying Capacity
Animal/Vehicle Capacity
Donkey 150
Horse 300
```

Adventuring Gear

Rules 2. 0?

```
When traveling, there are a variety of tasks
necessary to survival: staying on course, gathering
food, and getting shelter. Each of these needs is
accounted for by the following activities:
```

- Piloting. Piloting any vehicle you are traveling
  on.

```
Horse-drawn wagon 1500
```

```
Animal/Vehicle Capacity
```

```
Adventuring Gear
Item Effect Weight Cost
