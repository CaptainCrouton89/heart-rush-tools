# # Classes

Your class is the general role in combat that you
fill. It doesn’t say anything about what you do
outside of combat, and in games where combat is
more infrequent, your class will be less relevant to
gameplay compared to your aspects and talents.
There are three different classes—stronghearts,
battlehearts, and cleverhearts. Each has a distinct
combat style that makes them unique. Stronghearts
are beefier, and are responsible for preventing
enemies from killing their allies. Battlehearts dish
out the most damage, and are responsible for
downing enemies quickly. Cleverhearts fill a more
nebulous role of helping allies best fill their own
roles, and hurting the enemies in ways that make
them easier to deal with.
When you reach rank 1, choose one of the
classes and gain the abilities listed with the _Rank 1_
tag. Then, upon reaching rank 2, choose one of the
subclasses your class offers. Each subclass
specializes its own unique play style. For example, a
striker specializes in single targets, while a ravager
specializes in dishing out lots of damage to
everybody.

```
Within each subclass, there are three different
types of abilities: rank 2, rank 3, and rank 4 abilities.
Upon reaching each rank, gain the corresponding
abilities from your subclass.

Strongheart

```
Stronghearts are accustomed to taking the brunt
of the damage in a fight. They can survive more hits
than other classes, and do best when they are in the
thick of the fight. They generally have ways of
keeping enemies engaged with them, rather than
threatening their allies. Three types of stronghearts
exist—bastions, wrathguards, and vicehands.
