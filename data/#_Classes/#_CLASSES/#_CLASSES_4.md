_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._

Spelltouched can be used as a subclass for any
other class. You can play a strongheart, and then

any of the battleheart or cleverheart subclasses with
this subclass instead.

Spelltouched

_Also known as: Gish, Eldritch Knight, Arcane Archer, Spellsword_
A dwarf charges forward, cloaked in flames, his
fists blazing with fiery energy. With a swift motion,
he raises a wall of fire behind the ogre, trapping it,

```
and then strikes with a searing punch, sending the
creature tumbling back in a smoldering heap.
A gnome darts ahead, each step propelled by the
wind itself, carrying her swiftly toward the looming
giant spider. With a graceful twirl of her blade, she
slashes at the creature’s thorax, releasing a
concussive blast of air that hurls it backward.
An elf raises her hand, and a towering wave rises
from the earth, sweeping the fleeing thugs back
toward her. With a sharp stomp, the cobblestone
beneath them seems to melt, dragging the panicked
foes into the ground, immobilized.
Spelltouched blend elemental magic with martial
prowess, wielding their attunements to shape the
battlefield. By casting spells, they can deny areas to
their enemies, unleash devastating attacks, and
manipulate the movement and position of their foes.
Spelltouched gain the following abilities.
