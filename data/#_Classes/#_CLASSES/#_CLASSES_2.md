## # CLASSES

By aiming for a very specific location on your
target, you maximize your potential damage, at the
risk of dealing less damage if you miss. If you have
advantage on an attack roll, you may declare the
attack to be a called shot.
If you do, announce a target number for you
attack roll. Keep this number in mind for later.
Then, it’s time to determine the multiplier. Your
multiplier starts at one, though you may remove
levels of advantage on your attack roll to increase it.
To increase the multiplier by one, you must sacrifice
a number of levels of advantage equal to the current
level of the multiplier. So to increase the multiplier
to two, you would have to spend one level of
advantage. To then increase it to three, you would
spend two levels of advantage, and so on.
Finally, make your attack roll. If any of the dice
you rolled are equal to or higher than your target
number, multiply your target number by the
multiplier and add that to your attack roll.

Power Strike
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Before you announce your stance in an
engagement, you may declare the attack to be a
power strike. If you do, all dice used in the attack
roll trigger your Brutal Attacks ability if they land on
a result greater than half the size of the die. For
example, you would reroll and add another 1d10 to
the result if you rolled a 6-10 on a d10 in your attack
roll.
```

```
Execute
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
Whenever you deal damage to a creature, you
may choose for it to be an execution instead. If you
do and if this damage would reduce the creature to
zero or fewer hit points, the creature immediately
dies.
```

```
Devastation Strike
Major ability. Instant. Rank 4.
You deliver a massive blow, potentially finishing
off your enemy. Until the end of the round, you may
use each of your minor abilities once for free. In
addition, you may spend any number of your rush
points to roll 1d6 and add it to your next attack roll
this round. If you do not attack this round, it does not
count as using this ability.

Example (Called Shot)
Let’s say you have four levels of advantage
and you are about to make your attack roll with
1d10, 1d8, and 1d6. If you rolled normally, this
would mean you rolled 1d10 + 1d8 + 5d6, and
then dropped the lowest four. However, you want
to try for more. You decide that you are going to
give up three levels of advantage—one to
increase your multiplier to 2, and two more to
increase it again to 3. You then set your target
number to 5. You then roll your attack with your
one remaining level of advantage: 1d10 + 1d8 +
2d6. You get an 8, 3, 5, and 1. After dropping the
lowest die you have an 8, 5, and 3. Since 8 is
greater than 5, you hit your target and add 5 times
your multiplier of 3—resulting in an additional
15 added to your attack roll of 16 (8 + 5 + 3),
resulting in a 31 total.

A lithe woman draws forth a paper thin blade of
steel, sharp as a razor. With a short hop, she begins
to move, jumping like lightning from foe to foe,
lopping off heads and severing limbs in an endless
graceful dance that only she can understand.
Ravagers are masters of the horde. They have
learned to wield multiple blades at once, always
capable of choosing the right weapon to gain the
edge in the fight. No battle is too thick for a ravager
to enter, and then leave again with a trail of bloody
corpses in their wake.
Ravagers gain the following abilities.

Everywhere At Once

_Passive ability. Rank 2._
You are capable of combatting multiple enemies
at once. Whenever you enter an engagement, you
may force two enemies to engage rather than just
one.
When you do so, you may make a melee attack
against any number of valid targets in the
engagement rather than only one. If you do not make
any melee attacks, you may instead make a ranged
attack against any number of valid targets in the
engagement who are adjacent to each other.
Additionally, stowing and drawing weapons
counts as a free action, and can be taken at any time,
including between attack rolls.

Li g h t n i n g R e f l e x e s
_Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3._
Your reflexes are faster than anyone else’s on the
battlefield. During this round, you keep priority after
using abilities. If you choose not to use an ability
while you have priority in this way, priority is still
passed to the other side as usual.

```
Bloodthirsty
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 3.
You can launch from one foe to the next with
grace. When you deal enough damage to cause a
creature go unconscious or die this round, you regain
an action at the end of the engagement (to a
maximum of one). When you attack a creature that
has not been attacked yet this round, you get AD3 on
the attack roll.
```

```
Blitz
Major ability. Rank 4.
The rhythm of your movements synchronizes
perfectly with the fight. Until the end of the round,
you may spend one rush point to make a free
opportunity attack against an enemy and take the
sidestep action. You cannot make an opportunity
attack against the same target more than once.
```

Cleverheart

```
Cleverhearts are best at providing help to their
teammates—either augmenting their attacks, or
debuffing enemies to make their attacks weaker.
Two types of cleverhearts exist—battleminds and
spelltouched.
```

```
Above the Fray
Passive ability. Rank 1.
Although not necessarily the best at dishing out
the damage in a fight, cleverhearts excel at
everything else. Once per round, you may make an
object interaction, sidestep, help, or trip action for
free.
```

```
Tac t i cs
Minor ability. Instant. Rank 1.
You can spot out the weak points in your
enemies’ defenses and direct your allies towards
