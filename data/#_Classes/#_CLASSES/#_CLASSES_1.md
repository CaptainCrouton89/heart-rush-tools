Subcl ass: Wrathguard

_Also known as: Warrior, Sentinel, Barbarian_
A woman stands tall, war-hammer in hand,
daring the snarling werebear to make a move. When
the beast finally lunges, aiming to bypass her and
strike her ally, she reacts with lightning speed,
bringing her hammer down on its back with a
resounding crack, sending it crashing to the ground,
whimpering.
A knight, clad head to toe in gleaming plate mail,
stands firm at the center of the fray. Shield raised,
she swings her mace in wide arcs, keeping half a
dozen goblins at bay. They scramble to dodge her
whirling weapon, only to be cut down by her
advancing allies.
As two armies prepare to clash, a lone figure in
nothing but a kilt and a hammer charges out from the
front lines. Arrows rain down upon him, but he does
not falter. Reaching the enemy’s ranks, he unleashes
a sweeping blow, knocking three soldiers off their
feet, and the battle begins with his roar echoing
across the field.
Wrathguards are fierce, unyielding war
machines, thriving in the heart of combat. They can
withstand punishing blows and return them in kind,
and no matter how battered they are, they rise again,
ready to fight.
Wrathguards gain the following abilities.

Subcl ass: Striker
Also known as: Ranger, Bounty-hunter, Assassin
A lone halfling stands atop a boulder,
overlooking the chaos of the battlefield. In the blink
of an eye, he draws and releases, and another enemy
falls, his arrows swift and unerring.
From the shadows of the rafters, a woman drops
silently onto the false king's back. With a swift,
precise motion, her blade finds its mark, and blood
spills before the king crumples to the floor. In the
next instant, she vanishes, leaving no trace.
An old man perches high in the branches of a
tree, unseen by the caravan below. With quiet
precision, he draws back his bowstring and releases,
sending an arrow straight through the driver's heart,
ending the journey in a single, silent breath.
Strikers are lethal assassins, masters of precision
and efficiency, capable of bringing down even the
mightiest foes with deadly accuracy. Whether
wielding a bow, blade, or any other weapon, Strikers
turn their tools into instruments of death, striking
fear into the hearts of their enemies.
Strikers gain the following abilities.
```

```
Called Shot
Passive ability. Rank 2.
You exchange some defensive ability for
overwhelming offensive prowess. You have
disadvantage on defense rolls, but you may make
called shots.
```
