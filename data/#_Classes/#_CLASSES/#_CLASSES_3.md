Subcl ass: Battlemind

_Also known as: Commander, Mastermind, Tactician_
A battalion commander stands atop a boulder, her
voice cutting through the chaos as she issues sharp,
precise commands. Beneath her, soldiers move as
one, each order turning the tide of battle further in
their favor.
At the back of his company, a man with steely
eyes watches a pack of wolves approach. With a
swift gesture and a few barked orders, the company
converges, taking down each wolf in turn with
practiced efficiency.
A woman moves gracefully among her allies, her
blade flashing as it strikes her opponent’s shoulder.
With a commanding shout, she rallies her
companions, guiding their movements into a
powerful, unified assault.

Subcl ass: Skirmisher

_Also known as: Rogue, Swashbuckler, Jack of All Trades_
A wiry figure darts between the shadows,
slipping past a lumbering ogre’s sweeping fist. With
a quick flick of the wrist, she throws a handful of
sand into the creature’s eyes, blinding it and slipping
away before it can even roar.
Despite standing amid a dozen pikemen in a
frenzied brawl, a goblin seems to simply melt away
away from the thrusting pikes, evading every swipe
and thrust aimed at him. Then, with a sly grin, he
lashes out, tripping an overzealous soldier and
leaving him sprawled at the mercy of the goblin’
allies.
With a smirk, a tall elven women swishes her
rapier up and flicks the ear of the orc before her.
With a roar, the orc charges forward, but suddenly
the the elf is behind him, pushing him with her boot
into the wall beyond.
Skirmishers are elusive and unpredictable,
dancing around the battlefield with an unsettling
ease. They specialize in dirty tricks and misdirection,
exploiting every weakness to leave their enemies
vulnerable. Hard to pin down and even harder to
catch, they disrupt their foes and wear them down
with a series of debilitating strikes.
Skirmishers gain the following abilities.
